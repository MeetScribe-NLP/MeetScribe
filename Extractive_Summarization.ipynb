Council Bill one one two three has passed. Councilman Espinosa were you put to council bill 113 four on the floor? I move that council. Bill 113 for series 18 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. It has been moved if I can get a second. It has been moved and seconded. The public hearing for Council Bill 1134 is open. May we have the staff report? Yes. Katrina Madigan with the Department of Public Health and Environment. Let me open the presentation. . I'll give a very brief overview of the ordinance you're considering today to get things started. as you all know an ordinance of the Green Roof Initiative passed on the ballot last November. We formed the Green Roof Review Task Force to develop recommended modifications clarifications and improvements to the initiative through a collaborative consensus based process that will honor the vote. A little reminder of who was on the task force. We had two council members four city staff. Green roof proponents as as the real estate sector who had led the opposition to the original ordinance and a number of additional experts the task force met. And nine times from January 19th through June 7th when they reached a consensus recommendation for all of you. And the original ordinance had a number of great benefits for our city. And the ordinance you're considering today and we think improves upon those benefits and honors them and does even better. to touch on each of them briefly that helps reduce the urban heat island. We have the third worst urban heat island in the country. And the new requirement has not only a partial coverage of a roof with a green roof but full coverage of all the roofs with cool roofs to help address urban heat island. The original ordinance would add green space and help with water and stormwater management in our city and the current requirement has similar options that honor those benefits. The coverage requirements are about 14% higher than the ordinance you're considering today. we'll add a little bit more green space for the voters. And the greenhouse gas emission reductions will be similar to what their original ordinance would have achieved through solar panels. to briefly review the compliance options that buildings will have. All buildings over 25 000 square feet for new buildings will have to install a cool roof. And they will also have to pick one other compliance option. And the options they have are to do a green roof or to install that same amount of green space elsewhere on the site on the terrace or on the ground. They can also pay for off site green. Ultimately they can do green in combination with solar panels or energy efficiency. a smaller amount of green in combination with some energy options. And that's similar to the original initiative where you could do a green roof combined with solar panels. Next they can do solar or they can do energy efficiency. And again it's similar to the original initiative where you could cover the whole roof and solar panels. And that's also the option here to cover 70% of the total roof area. Lastly they can get certified from a third party LEED or Enterprise Green Communities. For existing buildings. When they replace their roof they'll have to install a cool roof and pick one compliance option in addition to that they can add a small green roof or a small amount of green space to the site. They can pay for off site green. They can install solar panels get certification or they can enroll in a flexible energy program where they have five years to achieve similar greenhouse gas emission reductions as that solar option. And there's a number of energy efficiency options as as solar options in that energy program. with that. I'll stop. All . Thank you very much. We do have 19 speakers signed up to speak tonight I'm going to call the first five up to this front row. if you'd please come up to the front row that we can get through everybody and everybody has 3 minutes and you're free to take up the 3 minutes . But if four or five people in front of you have all said the same thing that you're saying it's also fine if you say I agree with those people and let us know that you're here and what your feelings are. the first five of you could come up with front row Bruce Ray Jesse Paris Luke Spencer Jack's Roger Melvin and Ellen Thorpe. If you want to come up to the front row and Bruce Ray you are up first. But good evening President Clark. Members of the council. Thank you for letting me be here tonight. My name is Bruce Ray and I'm with Johns Manville. I'm director of Governmental and Regulatory Affairs for them. Johns Manville is a Berkshire Hathaway company with our world headquarters here in Denver and the Johns Manville Building at 17th in California where we have 400 employees. We also have our world R&D headquarters in southwest Littleton where we have an additional 300 employees. We have three business divisions at Johns Manville Manufacturing Products insulation engineered products and roofing. Of course I'm talking about the roofing products here tonight. In fact we are our commercial roofing systems division is one of the largest manufacturers of of commercial roofing systems in North America. JOHNS Manville makes a wide variety of different commercial roof membranes for a wide variety of applications. We can supply membranes insulation and materials for green roofs cool roofs traditional black roofs and about everything in between. And when it comes to cool roofs we've been in that business for many many years and we're one of the companies that work with the California Energy Commission in their establishment of the original cool roof requirements in their Title 24 energy code. we don't have a dog in this fight. And from the outset we've offered our technical expertize which we think is is pretty important pretty vast to this process. And I think based on that overall expertize we're not in favor of mandatory cool roofs for two primary reasons. One is that it makes it makes for a more complicated and expensive design and construction. And then second it may increase carbon emissions since in our climate zone there's a little bit of a heating penalty that these cooler of buildings have to pay in the winter. It it takes more energy to cool or to heat them in in the winter. We to say at Johns Manville because we have such a wide variety of roofing products that there's there's a roof for every building. And that roof is dependent on the location of the building configuration size use and all these other factors. And that's why we have a wide many many very expert roofing design systems designers that help building owners and developers understand what is the roof for their particular location. we would urge you to not adopt this ordinance and instead let roofing system designers use their expertize in getting the roof for any particular building. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next up Jesse Paris. Jesse Paris Blackstar. It's a moment for self defense. Denver Homeless Sellout and Community Action. Commitment for change. No hidden agendas. We are in favor of this ordinance change. I was in attendance for the subcommittee meeting on this. This whole chamber was full of overflow. this is a big issue at hand that we need to deal with this climate change. we're definitely in support of this. And also I'm delighted to hear that low and subsidized income areas will also have access to these roofs. Thank you. Thank you. Next up. Luke Spencer. Jack's. Mr. President ladies and gentlemen of the Council. Thank you. My name. Is Louis Spencer Jack's director of operations. For London Commercial Leasing Company. I am here speaking on my . The company they run and other companies. I support the Green Rush Task Force. With the new order of cool roofs. As far as adding. Greenery new structural designs it has become cost effective for. Building owners new construction belts. with that being said this allows us to get back to work and endeavor. Who a lot of us are in Denver. now because of this ordinance. We as everybody else we all have family. We have friends that we need to support. that's all I. Have to say. Thank you. Thank you very much Roger Melvin. Good afternoon. My name's Roger Melvin. I work for Seek a corporation. Seek a corporation sells roofs in 82 countries around the world. We've been in business for 60 years. The only thing we've ever made are white thermoplastic cool roofs. We have not made black roofs. We hail from New England in the United States and Switzerland and Europe is where our home bases. The point there is that both of those locales are in cool climates. The argument against. White roofs in this market is leaving the designers to make the decision that they don't want to be dictated to. the same argument was made in the electrical constituency when we made codes for electricity when we have building codes for insulation. Codes are put in place to protect the. Constituents that those people live under. the people of Denver have voted for a green roof initiative. It's very complex but you have the data and the scientific research out there to support the Denver Green Roof Initiative. The folks against it the folks that are in this room pitching that we need to leave it up to designers to the manufacturers to make the point it solely has to do with dollar signs and nothing other than that. They're not looking after the best interests of the city. They're not looking. At clear data scientific data. Denver is number three in the nation for urban heat island effect. And the voters of Denver have spoken that they want to change that. You've got the tools. Each one of the council members have been sent. A case study from Target Corp. which I remind you is a private privately run for profit organization that is put in place to do the best for their shareholders. They've done the research. The research paper that you have is based on multiple roofs I think 25 roofs that are all ten years and older. And they have all successful track records. Thank you. Thank you. Next up is Alan Thorpe. And then I'm going to call the next five up if we can make room on the frontbench. That will be Kathy Bachner Mike Morris Brandon Routh Heimer Andy Chris and Caleb Ewing. If you want to make your way up to the front bench. Go ahead. Good afternoon. Good evening. I'm Ellen Thorpe with the EPDM Roofing Association. The EPDM Roofing Association is a trade association representing three primary manufacturers of roofing products in North America. Johns Manville You recently heard from Bruce Ray also Carlisle and Firestone. All of these companies make a wide variety of roofing products including cool roofs. As you've heard from us by now we are supportive of almost all of the proposed modified ordinance with the exception that we are against the cool roof mandate portion. In fact we developed a compromise where users could select two options instead of one and an additional path for a high performance green building option. We are very appreciative of working with the City Council grateful that you have read our e-mails returned our phone calls and taken our meetings. We appreciate that you have asked thoughtful and critical questions. You've heard from over eight roofing manufacturers in previous communication and from over 100 roofing contracting companies as represented by the Colorado Roofing Association. The Colorado Roofing Association has communicated with you on several occasions and has been consistent about their opposition to the coal roof mandate. We are also appreciative of the work of the Green Roofs Review Taskforce and the monumental task that was set before them. But nonetheless we are disappointed that we are here. We are troubled that no roofing contractors or roof consultants were on the task force. We are frustrated that when roofing experts were allowed to address the task force they cautioned against a one size fits all approach. But that council went unheeded. We are concerned that although five members of the Chorus Working Group recommended against a coal roof mandate they were told that removing the mandate was not an option. And we are disillusioned that although we submitted comments attended meetings through the public review process and submitted 16 peer reviewed studies questioning the efficacy of a coal roof in Denver we were told again that removing the coal roof mandate was not an option. And we were told that even though our compromise position allows flexibility and choice while preserving all of the benefits of the original ordinance. And here we are. We encourage the Council to continue to ask critical questions that will measure the impact of the cool roof mandate on Denver's urban heat island. The roofing industry the roofing industry manufacturers contractors and consultants is available and we are committed to working with you to preserve the will of the voters while creating a high performance green building network with attributes that will improve Denver's urban heat island. Thank you. Thank you. Next up Cathy Fastener. Thank you President Clark. Council members my name is Kathy Bachner. I am the executive director of Knapp Colorado the Commercial Real Estate Development Association. I'm the past chair of the Colorado Real Estate Alliance which represents over 16 real estate related organizations across Colorado. And lastly I'm the chair of Citizens for Responsible Denver and we oppose the passage of the Green Report initiative. The primary members of Knapp Colorado are owners developers and investors in commercial real estate. There are over 20 000 across North America many of which are active in Colorado and in Denver specifically. We design and build office industrial retail mixed use and multifamily spaces. I am here on behalf of those members and as a member of the Stakeholder Task Force to encourage you to pass Ordinance 18 1134 as submitted. The Stakeholder Task Force focused on two primary things as they did their work. Honor the will of the voter. This was a challenge because what the voters wanted and what initiative 300 would have given them were very different and eager compliance. It was our desire to create a program that owners developers and investors would eagerly want to comply with. This ordinance is a delicate balance of ideas and solutions that we are convinced will not only result in eager compliance but will ultimately result in even more environmental benefits than the original ordinance would have. For example the City Planning Department itself estimated that 90% of existing buildings would have been exempt under the original ordinance. This revised ordinance will no longer exempt them. Instead it gives them a variety of options that assures their participation in the program. One of the most pivotal changes is the requirement that all roofs new and existing include a chorus system with only a very defined few having exemptions for things such as special architectural features. The task force did significant research into this process with multiple roofing experts and have drafted extensive flexibility around these systems. This one change will have a dramatic improved effect on the original ordinance. Remember 90% of existing buildings would have been exempted and now they will have a way to participate. It is important for you to also recognize that Brandon who will speak in a moment as the chief proponent of the ordinance and me as the co-chair of the opposition are in complete agreement with this revised ordinance. And in this day and age coming to complete agreement on a consensus is a unique thing and I think you need to keep that in mind. by giving owners developers and investors a range of options Denver can deliver its green promises while remaining a great place to work live and invest. Thank you. Thank you. Next up Mike Morris. Thank you President Clark. Denver City Council. I live in lucky number seven. excited to be here. I also voted for the Green Roof Initiative 300 last November 7th. In my concern with the new draft ordinance resolved around the language in one of the green buildings draft. I was surprised with the new draft ordinance language on page nine stating that any residential building five storeys or fewer or less than 62 feet in height with over 25 000 square feet of gross area floor are exempt meaning all multifamily buildings that go under five storeys but over 25 000 square feet do not have to comply with green roofs solar or any other I guess proposed renewables. The white roofs are cool. Roofs are still mandated in that section. what I'm looking at is in multi-family permits in Denver. The year ending in May 18th Denver saw 10 343 multifamily home building permits. It was a record that year 14.4% year over year. we're essentially saying multifamily can be exempt from this process unless you go over five stories. Majority of the buildings around me are all five stories. This is a building then is in 275 units built in 2016. It already has a white and cool roof they already meet this compliance in 2016. this would be exempt. This building Broadway station 419 units built in 2009 with a white roof. They're already compliant. This would be exempt for the green roofs and solar. That's IMT Alameda Station. This is also exhibit 300 8038 units built in 2014. Exempt. And the last one in Observatory Park 550 units built in 2017. White Roof. This sold for over $92 million. We're trying to exempt buildings that are $92 million in. GROSS This is what our my concern is. I respect the committee's work and recommendations but the proposed draft needs to change that that verbiage from 25 000 square feet or more to less as the voters approved back in 20 back in 2017. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next up Brandon Reath Heimer. Hello. My name is Brandon Wreath. I'm here. I'm the proponent of the Denver Greenough Initiative. For months individuals from all spectrums across Denver worked tirelessly to come to a compromise that would honor the benefits of the original ordinance while making it more feasible for building owners and developers. Not only did we accomplish that but we have comprised something that is even a greater climate impact not to reduce our carbon footprint to also protect Denver from the effects of climate change that we will definitely see in the years to come. As proponent of the Green Roof initiative I believe the very foundation of our compromise lies with the requirement of cool roofs. Without this foundational piece we never would have reached consensus. This important requirement ensures lowering our urban heat island highland which would lead to lower fewer heat related issues and will lead to lower energy consumption leading to less carbon emissions. The task force worked very hard and very thoughtfully while drafting this new policy and I'm here today to ask that you approve this without any amendments. Thank you. Thank you very much Andy. Keith. Hello. Council members Mandy Keith president of Green Roofs of Colorado where an amenity space green roof design installation maintenance company. We've been operating in Denver since 2007. I was also a technical advisor for the Denver Green Roof Initiative and a proponent of it and I'm also a member of the city's Task Force on the Green Roof Initiative . I'm going to speak to this task force. I want to agree with what Cathy said earlier too. She said how this new initiative increases the reach of the initiative and will have more environmental and sustainability principles for the city of Denver. And I also agree with Brandon Reath Hamer and all the work that he's done. And this taskforce started as a highly opposed group and with very many variable constituents that they were representing. And during the course of these nine meetings that we had with the task force and over almost 40 hours of time we examined current research and the viability of multiple options that would satisfy the voters intent of the original Green Roof initiative. Amazingly we reached a consensus and not a consensus. Unanimous candidate census of the group with this new green building policy one that protects the will of the voters providing them the flexibility and the design and construction industry needs to operate here. This this new policy will help Denver continue on a path of resiliency and sustainability. Thank you very. Much. Thank you. Next up is Caleb Ewing and I'll call the next five if you could come up and we can make room for them in the front. Emma Dutton John deal into the. Grant Nelson and Sean GROSS. Go ahead. Thank you Mr. President. Thank you counsel. My name is Caleb Ewing. I am from Castle Rock I am not a resident of Denver but I do work primarily in the Denver area. I work for a company called Seeker Carnival. We are based out of Switzerland with our U.S. operations being based out of Massachusetts. I have to say go Red Sox or as a celebration went last night at least it wasn't the Dodgers. I would also to point out that some of the other manufacturers that we are in party with with the Vinyl Roofing Institute would be Douglass who is based out of Michigan and they've been there since 1978. And then another company called FiveThirtyEight who is based out of Ohio and has been there for over 25 years. I point out where these manufacturers are from because they are all in cold weather climate zones. Most of their initial installations were within a tight radius around their manufacturing plant. They have not experienced the widespread failures that maybe you may have heard of in some of the colder climates with coal roofs. If they had they would not be in business anymore. I would ask for your consideration to to that one that one fact as you hear horror stories of that might be contrary to that. All of the many factors that make up the EPDM Roofing Association do also offer cool roof options as you have heard and they also sell them in this climate zone in the city. if they did not work they would not be sold here. I'd only ask for you to consider that as you are coming up with a mandate you guys are all having to become experts in building code and building science which is an unfair task to ask of anybody considering all the other things you have to consider. But I would ask that you understand that the Green Roof Initiative was passed by the voters in order to have an impact on the urban heat island effect. If we can do that simply by changing the color and reflectivity of our roof surface then it is a very easy compromise for everybody to comply with. Leaving it up to building owners choice and designers is a good idea. And in fact I'm in support of that. To most degree however there are some things that cannot be left to designers and building owners. When I go to remodel my kitchen I am not allowed to use lead pipes. thank you building code for protecting my children. I would to say that. While choice is good we have to do what's best for our city. And I appreciate your time. Thank you. Next up Emma Dunn. Good evening President Clark. Council members. I live in the inspiration. Point neighborhood of District one and I work in the roofing industry. I support the initiative as it has been revised by the task force both as a resident. And as a member of the roofing industry. I want to congratulate the task force for the amazing work that they have done to come to a compromise. In my opinion the original problem with the initiative was that it wasn't researched by industry members and the task force has now taken time to do that and they have come up with an excellent compromise that many people are happy with. Most specifically the urban heat island effect will be addressed by the initiative and I believe it gets at voter intent for the initial passing of the initiative. And we need to think about that not whether we can make money whether we designers can have lots of choice. We need to think about voter intention and the long term effects on our city. The research is clear. Lawrence Berkeley National Lab has indisputable research that cool roofs prevent urban heat island effect and you can twist and manipulate data to show many different things. But a national lab is a trustworthy source and in this age of infinite sources they can tell us whatever we want to hear. . A rule you get on the Internet and you look for whatever opinion you want to find you can find it. we need to be careful about our sources. And the research is clear. And I know the task force has done hard work to analyze that and present you with a compromise which is a bit of a miracle in today's political landscape. I urge you to approve the initiative as it has been revised by the task force tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Could you state your name for the record? Am I done? Thank you very much. All . Next up John Dill. Thank you. My name is John Diehl. I am in Parker Colorado and I also represent a manufacturer. Caleb mentioned that I am the Dallas Roofing Representative. Our corporate offices in Michigan and we have been manufacturing roofing systems for over 40 years now. And we have installed billions of square feet of roofing in the United States and Canada. We offer both cool roofing membranes and dark non cool rated systems. Though we offer a variety of membranes we see the benefit of and recommend cool roofing systems to our customers. This is true in both warm climates such as Texas and Arizona and cool climates Colorado Michigan and even Canada. I am also a member of the Colorado Roofing Association and despite previous comments made by the Sierra and EPDM Roofing Association that quote the roofing community is unified in its opposition to the cool roof mandate and quote They do not represent me and many other members of the Denver roofing community. We support the Corps of Mandate. Despite their opposition all membrane roofing manufacturers make cool rated membranes and they can easily meet the cool cool roofing mandate. And all of the roofing contractors that I work with install both systems the insulation requirement for example they can and will install whatever the city code requires. As citizens of Denver voted and I think most of us agree we have to make changes to lower the greenhouse gases and reduce the urban heat island effect. The most energy efficient and cost effective way to make an impact is to require cool roofing systems. The proposal you have before you this evening is a great compromise. Through months of meetings information gathering and negotiations please honor the task force recommendation and mandate the. Use of cool roofs. and consideration. Thank you. Next up the interior. My name is Ian Thomas Tafoya. I live in the I'm a Lincoln Park and I happen to be the deputy campaign manager for the Denver Green Roof Initiative. I'm here today in support of the proposed changes to the code that was approved by the Denver voters. This bill provides options and requires buildings to do their. Part in meeting the initiative's goals. And I couldn't be more pleased that we're reducing energy consumption improving air quality reducing heat island effect and providing green space. I will note that the cool roofs. Are a critical component and must. Remain in the compromise. I'm pleased that the city industry proponents and opponents came together on the work here tonight. But let's be clear it wasn't an easy feat. Our all volunteer coalition was first turned away by the city and then we took our case to the voters. We faced big money and the -connected and still we prevailed. Even still our opponents asked the council to illegally halt the implementation of this law. Denver is ready to lead on climate change. We're entitled to clean air and clean water and we cannot let industry dollars stand in our way. I hope this serves as an example that we cannot that we can choose to be bold that the sky. Will not fall and that with. Government and citizens leading the way we can control. And have the hard fights to ensure a stable world for future generations. I implore you Council don't wait for. Citizens to push you further into climate change actions. We cannot falter. Time is short but Denver can truly be a world class city by standing with those around the world and innovating to slow climate change. And let me be clear. If you don't the citizens and voters will. Thank you. Next up Grant Nelson. Good evening Councilman. Council President Clark and members of council. My name is Grant Nelson and I live at 731 Norwich Court in Castle Pines. I'm a commercial real estate developer for the last 26 years have dealt about 3 million square feet of retail. I was the former state president of ICAC the International Council of Shopping Centers and I'm here and was on the task force on behalf of the shopping center industry. The original initiative has passed would have been very very damaging to the shopping center industry to retail and to Denver as a whole. I will commend Brandon and Andy and those who worked on the other side of this. They came to the table they learned and they made a compromise. And the compromise was based. On the core of part of the. Initiative. I think we were all better served to have a diverse coalition or a diverse task force and I think we all learned from each other. I would also say that it is hard in this day and age to have opposing parties come together and agree on something and not only agree but we've agreed unanimously. I would ask for you to support the initiative as designed. And I also want to commend Katrina and the staff in Denver. They did a great job of bringing us together and allowing us all a voice. Thank you. And I'm available for questions if anybody has any. Thank you. Thank you. And next up Sean GROSS and then I'll call the last four Paul Reed Jamaica Berman Phil Chavez and Jennifer Boosler. Coming up to the front. My name is Shawn GROSS and the co-owner of Maverick Roof Coating. And want to let you guys know that we do support this bill in particular the core roof portion for energy efficiency. And happy you guys have everyone's come to a compromise here. I look forward to seeing it get best. Thanks. Thank you very much. Next up Paul Reid. Thank you guys for allowing us to be here tonight. My name is Paul Reid. I'm a general manager of Northwest Roofing here in Denver. bottom line is this. There's a lot of roofing companies a lot of real estate companies other companies that are looking to grow. And I've personally seen I've been on jobs or we've came out to do a due diligence on some real estate and. They refused to buy there in Denver because of. Of how this bill was passed. It's about an affordable for them. these roofs were damaged. They needed new roofs. And it was plain and simple not affordable. But I do believe this new task force has put together a compromise that we will all be able to live with and be able to do and we'll be able to get back to work. That's been another issue. We we do have over 250 employees as that we haven't been able to do work in Denver because of this this bill. thank you guys for your consideration. And we highly suggest that we get this passed tonight. Let's get back to work. Thank you. Thank you. Next up Jamaica Burman. Thank you Councilman Clark. She added My name is Jamaica Burman. I am with the building manufacturer GFT the world's largest roofing manufacturer. I was also a Denver Task Force member and I represent the roofing community. I've been in the roofing industry for 12 years both on the contractor side and the manufacturers side. And I want to bring up to date to where we're at today. Three roofing permits have been poured in Denver. We're clearly in a building halt. I support the task force recommendations and and anxiously look forward to telling the roofing community they can get back to the work in the city of Denver. Stantec the consultant on the task force found that 87% to 95% of existing buildings can't handle the weight of a green roof. With that being said the task force came up with this being the best decision. I believe that the cool roof mandate is the best possible option that respects the voters intents to assertively combat Denver's urban heat island effect. Over the last ten months Jeff and the Sierra Colorado Roofing Association have been updating the roofing community on the proposed changes. I've been hosting a series of events that focused on training the roofing community on cool roofs green roofs and solar that we are ready for this when it is passed. . Thank you Felicia Chavez. Thank you council members. My name is Phil Chavez and I'm the general manager of Top. That commercial roofing. We are in support of the. Task force proposed changes to the green roof mandate. Our firm looks forward to getting back to work as soon as possible in Denver. And I appreciate everybody's hard work to get to this point. Thank you. Thank you. And last up Jennifer Bruce looked. Thank you. Council members I appreciate it. I'm Dr. Jennifer Bustillo and I'm a professor at Colorado State University in the Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture. But of course I'm not representing the university. However I am representing the science behind Green Roofing as I've spent most of my 15 year career studying and peer review publishing the effective use of green roofs here in Denver Colorado. First I want to address the question that Councilmember Herndon mentioned at the October 12th hearing about cool roofs locally and their benefit on the urban heat island. I was on the research team at the EPA and CSU research facility at 16th and Wynkoop. Ten years ago when we did a three year study on the urban heat island effect and what we found was that green roofs reduce the temperature above the rooftops by up to four degrees or that seven degrees Fahrenheit. it's four degrees Celsius or seven degrees Fahrenheit annually. That's on an annual basis. And you may recall that the in Denver the urban heat island effect is about means it's about ten degrees hotter in the city versus in rural areas. green and therefore cool roofs can make and have made a big difference here in Denver. I was honored to be on the Green Roof Task Force alongside Councilmembers Susman and Clark. I encourage you to consider approving this proposal as it represents an enormous amount of effort and compromise by many stakeholders. I know I had to do a lot of compromising because I wanted 100% green roofs all over the city. And your support will ensure a greener future for all citizens of Denver. Thank you. Thank you. And sorry about getting your last name out there. And I we did have one more that didn't end up in the system somehow. . Dan Cupid. Good evening President Kirk and Denver City Council members. I returned from inspecting the completion of a very difficult roof in Snowmass Village. This report was replaced in eight years due to severe condensation. In fact the roof skated badly that they had to shovel off rotten sheathing in small pieces to get them off the roof. I've seen this type of thing happen way too often and this is one of the reasons I got involved with the Green Roof Initiative review process early on working with the city and county of Denver. We were able to agree on language and of portion of the proposed green building ordinance that we help to prevent this type of condensation. My name is Dan Cupid and I make my living as a roofing expert designing roof systems and testifying and representing cases. I'm a longtime active member of the Colorado Roofing Association on the Education and Coding Standards Committees and I'm a board member of the local RCI chapter. I've been involved with this Green Work review process since early January by providing roofing related information and recommending professionals to serve on the Green Review Task Force and also the Green Rope Technical Advisory Group. I have reached out to many of my colleagues during this process including designers contractors and manufacturers in order to obtain an obscure and share their input. Jamaica Merriman Wood Jeff was selected to represent the roofing industry on the Green Rope Review Task Force. She has worked with our Carbon Standards Committee our group subgroup and myself during the last ten months. Jamaica has been transparent impartial during this process. I have been part of the Cobra subcommittee meetings along with Richard Boone Kate Grabowski James Kirby Jamaica Bourbon which whiskey of TAF and manufacturer representatives from Johns Manville. Over the last five months we worked with Katrina Madigan from Environmental Services. in Resa Lucero was the sustainability and Scott Prisco and Daniel Krauss in the building department to shape the core portion of the Denver's green building proposal. We also proposed code language to ensure a core of systems are properly installed to protect against the type of condensation I mentioned earlier with cool roofing as a requirement and an proposed green building ordinance. We wanted to make sure it was as inclusive as possible. And in keeping with Colorado's extreme climate. Working with the city and county of Denver employees and various manufacturers I feel we accomplished our goal as best as could be expected. Through this work we were able to include concrete towers and balance to the roof systems that act as a different type of coal roof system that saves on energy costs along with most metal roof systems that are common in industrial areas and would have otherwise been excluded. As industry representatives we do not promote or choose one type of roofing over another. There are a wide variety of roofing and waterproofing products available in Colorado that perform in our climate. While we don't support a crew of mandate. I myself understand the need for an equivalency as an alternative to the current requirements in the Green Roof initiative. There is no doubt a change is necessary that roofing projects to. Such a large extent is a way. Thank you. Thank you. All . That does conclude our speakers. Are there any questions from members of council or Councilman Espinosa? I don't know if this is for Scott if he's still here or maybe Adam but there was a mention of a concern about the specific language on page nine. And I want to confirm that that that that is only for the the additional requirements that the core roof requirement. The I should I'll reference it. Let me pull it up here. That specifically 1310 dash 301a1 is the core proof requirement and it would apply to buildings as described greater than 25 000 square feet. Multifamily residential five stories less than 62 feet and a half feet. It's only the additional requirements about greenspace cover and what not. That is is exempt. That's correct. The residential buildings five stories or fewer do have to comply with the core roof requirement. If they're over 25 000 square feet they don't comply with all the other options. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Flynn. Thank Mr. President. I have a couple of questions that I don't know. We're covered in committee and a couple. There were occasion tonight as Brandon. Where's Brandon? Hi. Could you come up for a minute and Katrina while you're walking up? Brandon I'm trying to understand what was the purpose in the initiative of exempting residential buildings of four storeys or no greater than 50 feet whichever was less? What was the purpose of that? More cost and burden. I'm sorry. Cost and burden. Oh . Thank you. And Katrina. Then I notice that it's changing here from a exempting five storey five storeys excuse me? Four storeys and 50 feet or less. Orgill is going to take this or 62.5 feet. And what's the purpose of that change? yes good evening. Jill Jennings goal at Community Planning and Development. Sorry we're tag teaming on questions here. you tag her? . to start. the original initiative did look at a four storey limit. There was concern with limiting and with adding some compliance options based on what construction types that go up to five storeys. And there was a concern about artificially limited limiting buildings to a certain height based on requirements in this initiative. that's how the compromise came to that. They would still have to do a cool roof but would not have to do other components. I was answered for Councilman Espinosa. And then they still have to do the core of and the change was made primarily because of the construction type. When you're still at four storeys it's with still wood frame ? Correct. Excellent. That's thank you. That's very good. And maybe I don't know is is there a city attorney here who worked on this? Or maybe I should ask our our own. Hello over there. I noticed there was a word a different word used in the initiative versus the bill before us. I'm wondering if there's a if that's an actionable change or if it means the same thing. Is there a difference between an exemption the class of of structures that are under an exemption in the initiative whereas in the bill before us it says exception. Adam Hernandez Assistant City Attorney The intent. Was not to have any difference. they mean the same thing. I was trying to make sure that we're not making a change without coming to to discuss it. And then finally Katrina or Jill maybe one of you could tag each other and answer this. How do exemptions work with large but historic structures that might have pitched roofs? And do they will they automatically qualify for an exemption? And if do they do they nevertheless have to pay a fee? I'm thinking particularly of the Loreto Heights campus which is which is going to be facing some redevelopment. And they have a historical building down there with a black shingle pitched roof. That would be very difficult. Would they have to provide offsite or onsite Greensburg? Do they have to comply? there is no automatic exemption for historic buildings. However what we have built into the ordinance especially as it pertains to the cool roof requirement because we know that many historic or unique buildings in our city that roof is a very important element of the overall character of the building. if one has what the ordinance is defined as a character defining roof you can request alternate materials instead of meeting the cool roof requirement based on a staff review of finding that yes indeed that roof is important to the overall character and then any portion that's visible of that roof would not have to comply with the cool roof requirement. But the other compliance options still apply and we believe that there are enough options for any building to be able to meet the needs of the building owner and still work for the program. that night that 1890 Frank and Brooke building all of the roof of course is visible. they could be exempt. They could get an exemption from the corps roof but they would have to choose from among the menu of other options. Yes that is correct. Thank you Mr. President. Thank you. Councilman Flynn Councilwoman Cannick. Thank you very much. Thank you to all of the speakers. I wanted to ask Jill Scott Briscoe is here. I don't know if he's gone but the question about how we protect folks from the potential installation issues or condensation things that. I read the Stantec report. What in our building code helps to minimize the risk? it sounded proper insulation is the answer. You're not going to save on your heating bill. According to the Stantec report you are not going to save on your heating bill by having a black roof instead of a white roof because the difference is marginal that it's about insulation and how other things that you build. I wanted to ask whether or how our building code is there. Scott Briscoe did have to leave but I've got Daniel Kraus from our architectural structural review team. But essentially we have requirements and the rules and regulations which if this moves forward will be going out for public comment that require submittal of a roof study. Daniel do you want to take it over from here? There are two types of Daniel Kraus senior architect for committee planning and development for Denver. There are two types of roof projects that would be subject on an existing building to the cool roof requirement and one would be a roof replacement where the existing roof comes off the building and a roof is put onto the building and the coat already requires installation of are 20 above or 30 but a minimum of 20 regardless of the roof type where in some instances it does not. We would require a study by a an architect an engineer who would show us where the dew point occurs and how to mitigate any condensation issue. And that Dan Cooper was mentioning was developed with experts on a roof recover which is where the condensation issues are much more common because there are no existing building codes to require any insulation necessarily on a roof for cover. you're putting an additional cover on an existing roof and that is allowed in some circumstances although often not. But where it is allowed there can be a condensation issue when you put the cool roof and for that there is an actual exemption where it is demonstrated that that would potentially create a condensation concern. There would be no requirement for a cool roof. On a roof recover. Thank you. That's Thomas. Thank you counsel. Can you do Councilman Ortega? Thank you Mr. President. I wanted to ask Jennifer. I can't pronounce your last name though far for Bustillo Abu-Salha. . I had a question about the science and I understand there are other cities that have done the white roof and wanted to ask if any of the work you've done has looked at the benefit and the effects from cities that have had this in place for a number of years and how that folded into the the work and the decision made to move forward with a white roof for Denver's program. Sure. the only data I have is specifically related to green roofs as one of the cool roof options. not white roofs specifically. And that's Toronto. And what they found is an annual drop of four degrees Celsius already in. And they've only initiated their ordinance I believe it was 2011. already they're seeing that that difference that we found already in Denver on a small scale. Is there anyone else in the audience that could talk about Chicago and the effect that or the benefit that Chicago has seen? I understand they've had a program that's been in place for many more years than what Toronto has had. Though I don't have recent data. I know they have around 8 million square feet of green roofs installed. I don't know about Kourou specifically and I don't know their current data on temperature. . Thank you. I have no further questions. Thank you. Councilman Ortega see no other questions. I have one that I think Katrina you might be the best one to answer but if you want to tag out then feel free to make my Harris question. I don't know if you still here but about the change in floors and then Councilman Espinosa I think touched on it . The only change between what voters passed and this is the compromise on that one floor. There is an additionally a different change when it comes to square feet. Can you confirm that that the change is the floor not a new exemption for buildings based on how big they are? That's different from what voters passed. That's . And the voter passed initiative it was all residential buildings for storeys and fewer were exempt. And now it's five storeys or fewer because as Jill said the wood construction goes to five stories. this to be consistent across construction type. And I might add because I didn't said when I was up here last time the question was that of course the core roof requirement was then added to all of those buildings which were exempted entirely from that arrangement. It's one of the ways the task force wanted to provide additional benefit. Thank you. Daniel Kraus CBD architect. It wants to make a clarification that the original ordinance had an exemption for a four story or 50 foot tall residential building and a 50 foot tall residential building. And again it could be the whichever. If you had a 50 foot residential building even if it were five storeys it would be exempt and a five storey building would often be that height. That's why one of the considerations in simplifying and saying a five storey building would be exempt because the 50 foot height was already within the exemption of the original ordinance . Thank you. Councilman Espinosa did you have another question? Come on. mostly. probably you might want to answer this one. in the code changes we can build a six story wood frame structure now. the key is the height. because we can build a podium before it used to be the common thing was three stories of stick on a concrete podium. But now we can build five storeys a stick on a concrete podium. is there can you explain to me how how this works? Because now you can have a six storey building stick framed . it's the interplay I would think between the height and the number of stories. And can you clarify the question? Because a six storey building regardless would not be exempt including residential building even if it were five storeys above a podium that would be considered a six storey building and not be exempt. then explain to me why it's significant. If we're referencing Stick Frame you could build a 2320 5000 square foot 50 foot high stick frame building and you could also build a six storey stick frame building. what is it? What is the connection between wood framing and the exemption? The more affordable housing types try to use exclusively the wood frame and not depend on the concrete podium that you're referring to. And those are the types of projects that would be hardest hit and the cost of the green roof would be passed along to the occupants who are trying to get into the affordable housing. the real challenge though for for from that perspective and I'm sorry this didn't come up in committee is that what we're talking about is a very marginal expense increase on a on the roof component. Not every single floor not every single facade not every single finish. It's the roof component in a lot of our affordable housing. And if it's less than 62 feet typically has a shingle roof which I think would conform to the character defining rules. did we unexpectedly make a carve out for four and five story substantial market rate projects which could readily accomplish accommodate a 1 to 4% increase in the roof component itself. When you say roof component you're referring to the cool roof because the five storey or a four storey or a three storey any height if it is 25 000 square feet including residential would be subject to cool roof requirements. Awesome. we're back down to the same question I asked before which is anything over 25 000 square feet period is required. With the exception of a single townhome a single family home or duplex. Yep. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Flynn you become famous president. I needed a clarification based on the answer to your question but it came out on on this question. thank you. All . Seeing no other questions and the public hearing for counsel go one on three four is closed. Are there comments by members of council or Councilwoman Sussman? Thank you very much Mr. President. Thank you all for speaking tonight. Very . I was very heartened by all the conversations we had on the committee and how much we all learned about roofing which I never expected to know much about. And and thanks for all the hard work of the committee members that came and gave your time up to discuss the how we could make this particular ordinance work. One of the things that we talked about at first reading and before I want to reiterate we've heard some folks from the roofing industry express a concern that the mandate for cool roofs might not be as all as wise as we. And they speak to things. We have heard a little bit about this tonight about perhaps condensation worries. I also heard that from the Roofing Association that perhaps a cool roof a white roof isn't as resistant to hail damage as some other kinds of roofs . And to that end I have asked the Department of Health and Environment if we wouldn't put in the rules that there be a very careful study and report about the effectiveness of what we are proposing to institute for our roofs in Denver. I think it's makes sense that if we are going to make some requirements on the building and the roofs that we understand that that whether or not they are performing the way we would them to perform for the goals of the ordinance. And they have said of course that they would make a report to council at least annually and put this in the rules about the effectiveness. Is it me? Is it helping with urban heat island? Is it helping with climate change? I know that that is a difficult study to make but I'm sure you will put your best efforts forward and and very happy that we're going to do that. I also want to encourage you to start that study now because you'll need to have basin formation of the roofs that are not cool roofs now and how they're performing versus the the new roofs that are coming in to do some comparisons that we're very that we're we're very cognizant of whether these rules that we're setting in place are as as effective as we want them to be. thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Sussman. Councilwoman Cannick. Thank you much Mr. President. And to Councilwoman Sussman I first want to thank you for the incredible amount of time that you guys dedicated to this. And I think that we were approached and many of us didn't have the capacity. Even if we had some interest we didn't have the capacity to take this on. And the voters put us in a position where we had no choice but to find the capacity. And I respect and appreciate the proponents and the voters and I respect and appreciate you guys. thank you. In particular Mr. President I know that you spent a lot of time trying to help to balance the the the the the interest here. The one comment I wanted to make is that I know that there was some concern raised about the residential buildings. where we are today is that I feel the exemption is pretty similar to the exemption that the voters passed. And I'm comfortable with it. But I also don't want folks to feel this is the only place where we've addressed or we can't address the environmental sustainability of residential buildings. I want to give two examples. One is that for most affordable dedicated affordable units where the prices are restricted and the folks have to income qualify most of those projects in Denver use something called the Enterprise Green Community Certification already. And they are working and they it helps them with keeping their operations costs down. they do it because it's the thing to do and because it's economical. And that's happening for those folks. I think for the market rate new construction it's important that we continue to look to our building codes for places where we can be putting those standards in in the in the the building code. And I it's my understanding that there's a pretty significant green building code update coming in in the next year or two that we'll have an opportunity to think about where we have gaps in what this ordinance covers and how we get to those gaps in the residential multi-family environments. I think that's important. And then the last thing is I think it's important for us to not monitor the cool roof in the and the heat island effect but I want to see for example how many buildings do the retro commissioning and how many buildings do the energy efficiency stuff. Because if folks aren't choosing those options and we may need to continue to look at ways to because what we know from our our education recently as a council is that we can't meet our climate goals without keeping that energy efficiency improving. Heat Island is one thing but we've got to keep looking. I think it'll be very interesting to track the paths folks are choosing. And I don't want us to feel Oh this is the only ordinance we're ever going to pass and now we've solved climate in the building environment. That's we're going to have to keep working at it. We know a lot more about how to do it in a stakeholder. Says this time. I feel confident that we have the tools in place to do that and that this important step is when we can learn from and then where there are gaps and we need other work we've got to continue to problem solve to do those things. thank you very much to the to the community for your patience and your willingness to participate in the conversation. Thank you. And I will be proud to support this ordinance as drafted. Thank you Councilwoman Kennedy. Councilman Flint. Thank you Mr. President. I too will be supporting this tonight although for perhaps different reasons. The the initiative passed citywide by about eight percentage points. In my district it failed by 18 percentage points. And in order to adequately represent the folks in the more suburban context I feel there's a need to at least outline that sometimes one size fits all solutions or approaches aren't the best and can have. Unintended consequences as initially written this the requirements of the of the initiative that was on the ballot could have been devastating to these small commercial strip centers that serve my working class neighborhoods and and along my corridors Federal and Sheridan because of the enormous costs versus the inability to recover those costs from small tenant base on a one storey commercial building that exceeds 25 000 square feet. There were enormous costs on that. And this revision thankfully removes a lot of that cost burden that that I think Brandon spoke too about when they exempted the smaller residential buildings as . And I want to thank the Task Force Council President Clark and Councilwoman Susman for their hard work on this to fail to approve this by our supermajority which is required tonight to fail to approve this doesn't and would not bring about a better resolution for for more options for those looking for greater options at simply one. It would feel to me to fail to approve this would be punting on first down and given the game the other day maybe that would have been better for the Broncos. But. But not for us. Not for us. . We tend to look at Denver sometimes not all of us and not all the time but we tend to look at Denver as looking it does outside this window. We're a couple of blocks away without recognizing that when you walk around the borders of the city in county of Denver we have a huge diversity of neighborhood types. And when I sat through the task force presentations and saw heat island effect we want to mitigate the heat island effect. And I look at the average nighttime temperature map versus the daytime and the changes. I see that in my suburban district single family some apartments Wadsworth Sheridan Federal we don't have we don't have the same issues that we have in the core of downtown which is where the heat island is concentrated. And how is it fair to say we have to solve the heat island effect down? We're not even we're not even experiencing it. And . I believe that this compromise that's been worked out given the various competing Kathee and Brandon at the same table probably glaring at each other at the first meeting and coming away side by side is a great testament to the power of compromise and working together. Maybe this isn't the last compromise. And I thank Councilwoman Sussman for calling for annual review or one year and let's see how it work. But what I do know is that because this was put into code by the voters in 2017 we were told that there were six about 630 roof replacement permits issued in this city 631 on the buildings that would be required to put a green roof one in 2018. far we have had three. And those three did not put on a green roof. They went to the planning board and they got an exception. That tells us that this this initiative was a significant problem for commercial building owners. I hope that this compromise will free that up because the very worst thing for my neighborhoods and for the commercial the older commercial buildings fifties and sixties era. The very worst thing would be for them to not be able to afford to replace their roofs to lose tenants and to board up their properties. I am very happy to vote yes on this agreement and I'm looking forward to a review on whether it does generate roof replacement and building upkeep and keep our building stock thriving and vibrant and serving our neighborhoods. I will be voting yes on this. Mr. President. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you Mr. President. First I want to thank you and Councilwoman Sussman for your work in bringing everybody together and working toward something that we can all support and be very proud of. I also want to thank Jack Paterson from my office who sat through all of the meetings and kept me fully informed on the work that was occurring. I want to thank the folks who came and met with me on all sides of the issue to raise various questions and concerns. I am going to support this tonight as as it's been brought forward. The only other thing I want to say is I think the work that's been occurring with our energy advisory board that administers our $2 million franchise fee from Xcel Energy has done a lot of work with various nonprofits and a lot of that happens with single family homes as . But as we hopefully get to a place in this city where we've we've approached a lot of that work and where we have nonprofits and others that might need to replace a roof. Hopefully we can see that fund maybe be utilized into the future that even the work of our nonprofits continue to not only benefit from the work that's been occurring to make buildings more energy efficient but contribute towards this overall effort as when it comes to having to replace a roof and be able to try to as much as possible be in compliance with with the rest of the work that everybody else is working towards. I'm happy to support this and great work everyone for rolling up your sleeves and coming together and finding something that everybody could could say we agree to. Thanks. Thank you Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa. . Part of me wishes that cool roofs were crazy expensive and that we applied this to duplexes that we could. there would be a new movement towards character defining roofs again. That that's me. self-serving. As a young architect you get pigeonholed to doing essentially toilet room details and roof details and you end up spending a few years doing the things. I see that. And it's fine that we've already grappled as a council with toilet rooms a couple of years ago and here we are with roofs. it's been a real pleasure for me to watch my colleagues council and clerk our President Clarke and Council and Susman develop their own skills with regard to roof and roof assemblies and things that that that are critical to the world to our built environment and to to see them all the way through these different committees still still getting more and more. And it's I don't know it's pretty cool. And but it speaks to how much how much how much this role takes us out of our comfort zone gets us to a place of understanding that we can legislate better rules. And kudos to you too and your leadership role in this task force. And kudos to all the task force members because it's pretty cool when you develop these things and get to that point where where everyone feels good about what's going to go forward. And it's a it's a it's a real pleasure for me to be able to sit here and in support of this and and why I say that is . District one Northwest Denver put this over the line . And Brandon I've always acknowledged this that Brandon and I we had our differences. ? We didn't have our differences. I always supported the notion I had problems with the technical aspects of it and where how onerous it seemed to be. But you didn't see me going out there and telling my constituents vote no. And the reason being is this exact situation which is it is the step in the direction. And I wanted it to win that we could come here and fix it and find something more workable because it moves Denver in the direction. I am wholeheartedly here to . happy to support this because it's not only what my constituents have been crying for they're not crying for it but spoke out loud in the last election that this is something they wanted and it is a way that we can implement it and for the better of this city long term. thank you to staff as for your efforts in shaping this and helping make that case again and again and again to the groups that the people that you were leading. thank you all. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Brooks. thank you Mr. President. one thing that has not come up during this conversation is historic buildings and representing one of the oldest areas in the city. I had a lot of concern of historic buildings and how this would fit into how they will be penalized or exempted and things that. And I want to thank the team for working with our community especially the LoDo district. They had a lot of concern about that and I appreciate they're probably the only neighborhood that was pushing hard and in my district around this and I appreciate you guys working on that. And I think it's a lot of times we I definitely want to say thanks to our our city council folks but the amount of time Katrina you put in jail you put in Adam Hernandez into the study over this stuff is unbelievable. thank you for your hard work on that. And obviously Dr. Sussman and President Clark thank you guys for working hard on this. Sometimes folks forget about they see you at the meetings but they don't know about the prep that it takes to get to the meetings. And appreciate you guys and then the community that's out here today. Number one thanks for sitting in those hard chairs going through security paying your parking and being here and caring enough about our city. No matter what side of the aisle you land on that you care enough about our city to get this done. I feel being the worst. What is it that the top three worst urban islands but yet putting this innovative collaborative solution together? We're going to be I'm going to get phone calls from my colleagues in Seattle and Portland. And I love that by the way saying that you got that we did a great job. And but you guys did an incredible job. I want Washington D.C. to watch what's happening here. This is this is communities coming together over a very tough issue. And I remember when this passed folks were going crazy on both sides. I was calm down everybody. And you guys proved that a city can come together come together and we want the same thing at the end of the day. appreciate everybody who worked hard. Thank you Councilman Brooks. Councilman Cashman. thank you Mr. President. I'll go the thanks to the staff and my council colleagues. Brandon Rice Ruth Heimer thank you for kicking the door open as we've had a couple of examples recently along with the Democracy for the People initiative of initiatives coming before us that we take a close look at and see problems with and working with the proponents to come up with something better. And I think the system's working real . And Brandon thank you for moving us into farther into the 21st century towards making Denver truly a leader in sustainability. And I've said it before I am tired of hearing Boulder Portland Seattle talked about when it's matters of environmental importance and your work is going to go a long way in putting us at the top of that discussion. Thank you Mr. President. Thank you Councilman Guzman. Councilman Lopez I want to to join in on the on the on the congratulations and the thanks for the hard work. But the one thing I'm going to I'm going to saying in that here on the floor that I said in committee is it doesn't end here. I think we will see true climate change. We will see change happen in our environment when folks who are everyday people living all over Denver who are not installing these things as their jobs but own the companies and have the skills to be able to do it and own their own businesses to do it . This is there's there is something to be said about the training something to be said about building that economy and making sure that that we grow those businesses and we. Make sure that those folks are able to have the training to be able to install them and then even take them one day down to the residential scale. And that isn't necessarily putting your regular roofing tiles on but being able to tap into this and maintain this technology. And that only happens when it's affordable. we have to be able to grow that part of the industry. And I'd to see not folks that look me installing these roofs but also owning the businesses that install these roofs. I think that's there is an economy to be to be to grow here. There's a trade to continue to do training. I think this is a good step and I'm going to vote yes. Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Councilman? I think it was surprising. I think my colleagues have stated everything very for our support tonight. And I want to thank all of the industry representatives and the professionals and the scientific community for helping provide the information that we're looking forward to do to support this initiative and understand the value and the benefits we're going to receive from it. It's very easy for us to explain to our colleagues when we have scientific data industry experience and information to support such an initiative and a change for our city. thank you for all your participation and input and advice and data and the support of our task force. Thank you Mr. President. Thank you Councilman. New seeing no other comments. I will end by saying one more round of thank you to Katrina and all the city staff who are here and not here who put in made the number of hours of the task force put in which was significant seem small in comparison. Thank you much for all of that to Councilwoman Sussman for serving on the task force with me and and being a great sounding board as we went through the process. To Cathy and to Brandon who for some of those first meetings I was oh boy. they're even sitting on opposite sides of the room. It was not glaring. It was and there were people paranoid about who's meeting in secret rooms and what are they deciding and to sticking with it and then sticking with each other as we got close to the end. And there are turbulent waters over this that and the other thing and saying here might be an opportunity where one side might pick up a little bit or a little bit of that and saying what no we went through this process together and we compromise. And I didn't get everything I wanted but neither did they. And that that's a tenuous balance. But to be able to come here tonight and thank you to both of you. Thank you to Brandon. I quote Councilman Cashman said As a guy who came into this job with very few credentials that that look this but a natural resource degree and training as an environmental educator this is a exciting night for me to to have this in front of us. And thank you for for doing that for our city. And then to all the task force members who are here all the ones who spoke I'm Count and other ones who didn't speak who could have kept us here for an extra 30 minutes or but are here and have been supportive. It's a lot of time that you are not getting paid for to be in a room wrestling around with people over something. And I appreciate all of your dedication and and hard work. it's to have this ordinance in front of us that now gets more environmental benefits will keep keeping people working who have not been able to work in the city for a little while and having eager compliance instead of rapid opposition is . Amazing. And Councilman Brooks almost took the words straight out of my mouth but I had written in my notes that the entire nation should look to this room to see how government can and should work and and take note that it's messy and it's hard work. And it took a lot of time and a lot of hours but it is worth it to be able to sit here tonight with this in front of us. thank you all for setting a great example for not as leaders in our city but for our country. with that Madam Secretary let's vote. And as a reminder we do need nine votes not seven to pass this tonight. Madam Secretary roll call. I. Brooks Michelle Espinosa I. Flynn I. Gilmore I. Cashman I can teach. Lopez I. Knew. Ortega I. Sussman All . Mr. President. I. Madam Secretary please close the voting announce results. 12 hours. 12 I's Council Bill 1134 has passed. On Monday November 5th. That's . You can clap for that one. On Monday November 5th 2018 Council will hold a required public hearing on Council 1160 designating 6302638 16th Avenue the A6 apartments as a structure for preservation.\",\n          \"please take these flowers these poinsettias during any time I should say any time. Please do it at the conclusion of this meeting that we can keep this meeting running effective and efficient. Councilman Cashman will you put Council Bill 1210 on the floor? Yes Mr. President. And I move the council Bill 1210 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. It has been moved and seconded. The public hearing of council votes often is opened. May we have a staff report? Andrew Webb. Good evening. Thank you Mr. President. Members of the Council. I am Andrew Webb from Community Planning and Development here to present on this proposed rezoning of 39 of property at 3944 North High Street. This property is this request is in Council District nine. It's in the Cole neighborhood near the intersection of High Street and 40th Avenue. It's about 8000 square foot property with a single industrial building on the site. And the request here is to rezone from the I.B. Industrial Zone District with the UO to overlay Idaho two to IMX three and that's industrial neighborhood context mixed use with a maximum height of three stories. Zoning nearby includes some recently zoned IMX three with the UO to overlay directly to the west of the subject site. I'd you oh two on properties all around the subject site with some you annex two and PWD and residential zoning further to the south of the site. Existing land uses include heavy industrial and transportation uses freight loading uses to the north of the site smaller scale industrial and mix of single and multi-unit residential surrounding the subject site. This aerial gives a sense of the scale of buildings in the area. As you can see it's primarily a 2 to 3 story industrial structures some turn of the century residential structures and then of course the the intermodal freight facility to the north. This photograph looking to the southeast shows some larger industrial uses to the east of the subject site including a Coca-Cola bottling plant. These images show the subject site itself. As you can see it is one industrial building and customer parking. This is the subject site directly across the street that was recently zoned to the I am x three zone district. The IP. The existing zoning IP is a general industrial district intended for very intense industrial uses. It does have some limitations on retail sales and that's important for the for this application. In this particular case the property owner is requesting this zone change. They are currently using the site for marijuana retail and the EIB's own requires that retail sales are only be permitted if the product sold is manufactured or processed somehow on site which is not occurring with this particular business. The request is again to IMX three. This is a mixed use district in the industrial neighborhood context. It does promote pedestrian scale development. Buildings located up at the street active ground floor uses of note for this application does permit standalone retail uses. It also introduces other uses into the industrial context including residential uses and is typically intended as a transition between mixed use areas and then higher intensity AI or IP use areas. In terms of process the first informational notice for this request went out in in late August. The planning board considered this request on October 18th and recommended approval. The committee considered it on November 7th. And here we are at the council hearing December 18th. There were multiple registered neighborhood organizations that consider this site to be within their their boundaries. And all have been notified of this request. We've not received any comment from RINO's about this request. As to adopt a zone change the council must find that the request is consistent with these five criteria from the Denver Zoning Code. With regard to the first consistency with adopted plans there are several plans that impact the site including the comprehensive plan and blueprint but also the River North Plan the Elyria and Swansea and Neighborhood Plan in the 38th and Blake Station area. Height Amendments. In terms of the comprehensive plan this request does further multiple objectives from the comprehensive plan generally aimed at encouraging redevelopment of the former industrial sites into compact mixed use areas around especially around high quality transit stations where people can live work and play meet all their daily needs in one place. This is relatively close to the 38th and Blake Station area as you'll see in subsequent plan slides here. Blueprint Denver calls this area out for a future concept. Land use of mixed use and does identified as an area of change is served by a on designated local and an alley both of which connect to 40th Avenue which is a mixed use arterial and appropriate to it to handle the type of development development that would occur in the I am x three zone district. The River North Plan recommended a concept land use of industrial mixed use at this site. Again that is that plan characterized that as less intense industrial residential and commercial uses in proximity to the at the time of this plan's adoption forthcoming transit station to be located nearby the Illyria and Swansea. A neighborhood plan recommended mixed use for this area with a focus on employment and noted that pedestrian access is is key in this area. And I'll point out that these are relatively small block sizes where the impact zone district is appropriate for calling for a high quality pedestrian environment. And then finally the 30th and Blake Station area height amendments adopted last year established a set of base and incentive heights for this area. I most of you should be aware by now that Community Planning and Development and Council President Brooks are working on a larger set of zone map amendments and text amendments to establish a set of design and incentive overlays in this area that would implement the 30/30 and Blake stationary height amendments. This request came in a little bit early. You'll be hearing the larger rezoning case beginning early next year. But this case came in a little bit early on on the request of the owner to to address the mismatch between the land use and the between the zoning and the land use on the site. However it's want to point out that this request is consistent with the recommendations of the 38th and Blake stationary height amendments and would establish the appropriate base height for this site. With regard to the other criteria this request is consistent with the requirement that it result in the uniform application of district regulations that will result in the uniform application of regulations for the IMX three zone district. It will further the public health safety and welfare by adopting or implementing adopted plans for creating walkable mixed use compact development near high quality transit. The property owner proposed the changed community conditions as their justifying circumstance. Here to meet criteria number four and staff generally agrees that there has been a lot of new development and redevelopment activity in the River North area especially since the opening of the University of Colorado Airline Station last year. With regard to consistency with the neighborhood context zone district purpose and intent this is does conform with the purpose and the intent of the industrial neighborhood context which is designed to provide a buffer between high intensity industrial uses such as the freight uses to the north of the site and residential uses of decreasing intensity to the south of the site. finally with that CPD staff does recommend approval based on a finding that all these review criteria have been met. The representative of the property owner is here and I'm also happy to stand for any questions that you may have. All . Thank you Andrew. We have two speakers this evening. I'd them to come to the front here. It looks we have enough room. Quinn. Crow means queen crow means represent the. Owners of. The Lodge or KTA LLC. All . You can have a seat if anybody is here for questions or your questions. great. Members of council can ask questions. When we get to that portion. All . 6 minutes Chairman Sekou. We can put it down to three. You want your six? . I reserve the to abort the conversation. . 6 minutes. Go ahead Mr. Sekou. My name is Chairman Sekou from the organized the Black Star action movie of self-defense advocacy for poor working poor homeless senior citizens. We support the zoning ordinance and change. And it's a wonderful thing to have this area developed and also given folks options as to how they can go about doing that process. And there's a caveat to this. Oh. Explosion and expansion of marijuana especially in our neighborhoods that are currently being gentrified. And we find a strange thing happening. When this whole thing started with this marijuana thing. The black community and this youth were going to jail and unparalleled numbers for joint. 4000 years. And now that this legal. Folks who didn't pay the price through their life are now benefiting from the suffering of others who are still locked up in jail for the same thing that's legal now. Now during the time of slavery when it was abolished you had to let everybody out of jail who had slave offenses . And yet to this day we have people languishing in the prison system still under this stuff. It's now legal. Now. And our neighborhood unemployment rate among you doing this whole period of time was 65%. And this was a means and ways for them to survive and take care of things they needed to take in order to live . And yes there were some things that wasn't necessarily kosher but it left them with the opportunity to practice what this country preaches. And that's creative capitalism. we handled things on the down low and we did after hours. you'll do what you do. And then we got to after hours we do what we do. But then we were persecuted for that. And now you have a monopoly sitting down in this mess of folks who didn't pay the price but benefited from the blood and imprisonment of other folks. And that's not fair. That's not fair. That's you're coming back and say we're going to do slavery all over again and take the country back to when it was great. we need to do something about this whole thing with this marijuana thing. Stop forgetting the things that matter especially when people are languishing in prison systems now for this mess and then free them from the past they can get on with their day today and give them hope. That did not forgotten. And I implore the folks who are now currently managing and benefiting from the marijuana expansion and zoning changes and whatnot to begin to lobby. For a resolution to this stuff man. Because what is being sold? It's our culture. That's our culture. That's our way of life. We've made it available for everybody else to enjoy that too at our expense. there's a resentment behind this whole marijuana thing this languishing and bubbling beneath the surface in the black community. And even though it's being gentrified there's enough still there that matters. And there's no excuses for this through as we continue doing this stuff. And I know the zoning change in the proper way. You would place to be looking at all of this. But now we have the possibility of putting this in subcommittee meeting to look at this thing this whole marijuana thing and see if we can make it something that's working properly and justice is being served. . my man 41 say that was pretty good. I'm done. I'm done. Thank you Mr. Sekou. This concludes our speakers for the public hearing questions by members of council. Councilman Ortega. It's a technical one looking at the list of the rhinos that were notified. I noticed that the cross-community coalition which represents the Swansea a neighborhood was not included is a reason that they were left off the notification list. Since it's in their boundaries. Councilmember Ortega I'll have to I'll have to go look that up. We use a typical use a GIS tool to pull down all of the orange shows that that would that whose boundaries would include a particular site. And when we pulled them for this particular site I don't think that one came up. either the boundaries the boundary doesn't quite include it or ends at 40th or there may be an error in the data we have. . I'm assuming that they are registered still. Council Council President Brooks you might know but they're they're active in that area . . Would you want. Repeating the name of this. Cross-Community coalition? And they represent the entire. once you boundaries I think you can. Is. O'LEARY Isn't that true? DUTCHER but it stretches and it's all O-M-G. Yes. . All . Look. . Thank you Councilman Ortega. Seeing no other questions. Public hearing is close. Open for comments. Seen no comments. Madam Secretary roll call. Black eye Clark. All . Espinosa. Flynn. Gilmore. Herndon. Cashman. Can carnage. Lopez. All . New Ortega. Sussman All . Mr. President. I please call the voting announce the results. 13 eyes. 13 eyes. 1210 has been approved. Congratulations. All . We have another public hearing this evening. Councilman Castro will you please put 1324 on the floor?\",\n          \"Thank you. By your vote we've given a recommendation and sent to full council the consent agenda items six through 11 and 12 a.m. on today's agenda. That takes us to item 12. Which is motion 2023 or one. Andy Macklowe of Castle Central Staff is here to beat the motion and amendments. The amendments being why it was not part of the council agenda. Andy the floor is yours. Mr. Chair we need to make Andy a co-host that's happening now. Great. Great. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Chair. For the record Andy McQuillan from Council Central Staff. Materials for this item begin on page 77 of the packet compose motion 20 2003. One would authorize the King County executive to accept a donation of 2.41 acres of property adjacent to the Upper Bear Creek natural area for fish and wildlife habitat conservation purposes. As you noted there is one technical amendment that begins on it that is on page 89 of your packet and it would amend the motion to update the assessed value using the most recent appraisal and would correct the type of real estate agreement referenced in the motion. There is also a title amendment on page 90 that conforms the title to the motion. This concludes my remarks. Thank you. Questions. A devout cast member? Dombrowski I think that showed this is maybe technical in nature but I believe that the title references land west of Wooden Vale Washington and the Upper Bear Creek area in my mind is east of Washington. maybe by the time we get to final council action that might want to be changed west of Woodinville would be Bothell. And I think this is east and unincorporated King County. Thank you. . Great. For the discussion questions. Councilmember Dunn. I'd entertain a motion. move Mr. Chair. Councilmember Dunn has moved adoption of motion to move to give it to passed recommendation the motion 2023 or one which puts amendment one the technical amendment that has been reached before in order. Councilmember Dunn move amendment one. Thank you. Amendment One is before us saying no discussion. All those in favor of adopting Amendment One please signify by saying I am opposed. Nay. The ayes have it. Councilmember Dunn for the title Amendment two one. Sorry. Move t1. T1 is before us. All those in favor please signify by saying I. I oppose nay. The ayes have it. The title amendment is adopted. That brings us to Motion 2020 301 as it has amended. See? No discussion. Madam Clerk would you please call the roll? Oh Mr. Chair excuse me Councilmember Dombrowski. And this is on final passage. Yes. I think it's worth noting that we have a private property owner here who out of the apparently the goodness of her heart is donating over two acres of land maybe assisted over $17 000 to King County to preserve it in open space in perpetuity. And that's a pretty generous gift to the public. And I thought we should take a moment to at least publicly acknowledge and appreciate that version's generosity and thoughtfulness for future generations as we adopt this legislation accepting the donation. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Chair. Madam Clerk. Thank you Mr. Chair. Councilmember Banducci I. Councilmember Dombrowski. Councilmember DEMBOSKY. Councilmember de. I again. I think you've done both sides. Councilmember Coles I. Council member I. Something. As a member of the. And from improv improvising there. I. Council members online. Hi. Mr. Chair. Hi. Mr. Chair. The vote is 99 zero now. Thank you. But by your vote we've committed to pass recommendation to Motion 2020 301. And with members concerned by your objection all of what have been the consent agenda item six through 13 inclusive will be expedited to full council a week from today and placed on the consent agenda. See. No no. Objection. ordered. I'm not mistaken. That takes us to item 14 our final agenda item today a discussion and possible action on the Council's state legislative agenda.

Thank you Councilwoman Robb. Your motion to adopt. Thank you Madam President. I move to adopt proclamation 441. Thank you very much. It's been moved and seconded. Comments by Council Councilwoman Robb. I always enjoy doing this proclamation. I think it's wonderful that when street sweeping starts again and when we get busy on our street paving program when even more people are biking and walking on our sidewalks and bikeways that we celebrate the. People who make all of that happen and I'm glad to do that tonight. I am very proud of the employees of the year. That is an outstanding achievement. And I'm saying this to anyone who is here or is listening because there are 1100 employees in public works in there are only ten of you. that's huge. Maybe this is making your career as Jim McIntyre talked about there many things that the department does. And I know many of my colleagues will probably want to chime in but I don't think a day goes by that we are not calling public works. Talking with Nancy Cohn. Talking with George Delaney. The proclamation lists a lot of this. Do I need to mention also the bond program and all the implementation of that program? I'm happy to do this. And I want to give a special nod to Cindy Patton who works in my district all the time. I know she works in many of yours. She should be cloned. I don't know some of the other recipients as as I know Cindy. But if you're as amazing as she is you should be clone too. And then we could have more public works employees which would be good. thank you Madam President. And I know my colleagues will support this proclamation. Thank you Councilwoman Robb. Councilwoman Kennish. Thank you Madam President. And I want to thank my colleague Councilwoman Robb for congratulating and recognizing this department as a self-described policy wonk. Before I got elected I thought I would be focusing on the sexy departments in the city be about economic development and human services. And I have been surprised by how integral the work that I have done to fight poverty build communities has brought me working closely with your staff. And I'll give my quick highlight list. Regional Policy. we are passionate on this council about pedestrian safety and walkability and multimodal transportation in the regional conversation. Sometimes those things are harder to achieve as folks want to build more lanes on roads. And I rely closely on the policy team and some of the experts in the public works department to think about how we talk about those issues regionally and make the whole region work together. And you guys staff us at a on a daily basis probably. And that work my work to create a open space. Caswell Monteiro and I work together in an area of Globeville. And we think of it as a park which is something very sexy but there's much public infrastructure in terms of stormwater and in terms of even getting down to curb and gutter which I'm sure you're going to help me pay for. But those pieces having public works at the table to create an open space out of a blighted area and all the way through the other pieces of the city's work. I've been surprised and delighted by what I've learned from working with you by what I've gained by having you at the tables that you've been willing to participate in. And I thank you for that broad reaching approach which isn't how do we build or maintain infrastructure but how do we achieve goals for people in ways that infrastructure can support them? And that's that's cool. And I appreciate it. And I know it extends to all of the divisions that I represented today with the priorities. thank you. Thank you Councilwoman Carnation. Councilman Neville if you don't mind I want to riff off of that. I'll give you the last word. I'm not exactly a policy wonk but I am a city nerd. And Public Works gives me the opportunity to talk about things that bother my friends sometimes street paving and sidewalks and traffic lights and urban drainage. I can talk a lot about urban drainage and gutters and sewers and and finally they have taught me how to talk trash. And I could talk trash in a very polite way. And I have enjoyed working with public works much. It feeds my inner nerd . And this is -deserved. Councilman Levitt. Thank you Madam President. Does that make me a policy punk? I don't mean perhaps. Going with the theme. This along with the the hepatitis C proclamation is a is a perennial but one that I'm always happy to see because it's an opportunity to celebrate the department and its employees who don't often get celebrated. Public Works is is the atlas that holds up the world. we spend a lot of time being excited about the world but we don't give proper credit to the atlas that holds it up and public works does that in. A thousand different ways that are rarely recognized. it's great to have public works week and to be able to recognize public works for all they do. It's the the bottom of the food pyramid. Nobody gets excited about the whatever the hell is on the bottom of the food pyramid but nobody gets excited about it. But it's it's the pyramid that holds up the rest of it. And that's what public works does for us holds up our world. And thank you for doing it. Thank you Councilman. It looks Councilman Lopez going to get the last word. Oh great. Thank you. I I also wanted to to publicly thank the Department of Public Works. You do much in our city and I know we are constantly calling the department and in public works is the department of many different departments. It is the the quintessential bare bones minimum of the city. If there is one thing we do it is the work that we do in public works. And if there's one thing that best defines the role of government in the whole purpose of government to do the things for the many that we can possibly do for the individual . Public works and public works achieves that . If you drive down a street you may hit some potholes but chances are in Denver you don't. Why? Because they do such a good job. They do such a good job. They did it in a district that I represent. And for 25 years. Some people may laugh about it but for 25 years nobody had touched it. And because of the leadership in public works because of the men and women in public works you won't find a pothole in Villa Park. You won't find a pothole in some parts of Westwood now. And instead you find neighborhoods that look built that are created and that are built to last. And you see bike lanes on Morrison Road and Knox Core ? You see different things that are happening in our city. And this is all done by the hands of the people who call the city home who happen to work in their public works. I happened to work on West Alaska Place in the Westwood neighborhood while we were paving. We go out every year and think folks are paying pass out Gatorade and and water. And lo and behold one of the people who was paving the street lived on that street and grew up on that street. That's what makes this department special ? This year we may talk trash once in a while but a manager got an AHA. You run a very good shop with a great manager at his helm. thank you. Thank you Councilman Lopez Councilwoman Monteiro. And thank you Madam President. I also want to take the opportunity to extend my appreciation. I wish I knew all 1100 employees. But here's what I do know that public works does everything from Keep Denver Beautiful this far as graffiti graffiti removal all the way to major projects. I'm very mindful of the role that Public Works played in the redevelopment of Denver Union Station and the work that you're doing currently regarding I-70 and the National Western Stock Show. And we couldn't we couldn't do wouldn't be responsive if we didn't have the help of solid waste. Also permitting and enforcement have worked with a lot of people their street maintenance. And then of course Nancy I have an inbox of a lot of emails that you and I have I'm going to have to start deleting some of those. I also want to extend my thank you to host Cornell for all of the work that you do and that and for your steadfast steadfast leadership. And also to George Delaney who you're there when Jose is away from the helm. And I appreciate that. congratulations again. Let me see if I got these names . Jason Chloe Adrian Luis Jeremy Cindy Patrick and Ron. I hope I got everybody's name. Thank you. Thank you Counselor Monteiro. All . Looks we're ready for the vote. Rob I. Shepherd I. But I. Herndon I can eat lemon. Lopez All . Monteiro I love it. Hi Ortega. Hi. Madam President. I am close to voting out the results. 11 eyes. 11 eyes. The proclamation is adopted Councilman Roberts or somebody would to call up to the podium. Yes Madam President I expected my colleagues to support this but I hope no one out there was insulted with some of the comments. I would to call up the interesting sexy cool and strong executive director of the Public Works Department which is an interesting sexy cool and strong department. Good one. Councilwoman Rob. Cook. I'm single network secretary director of Public Works and I want to thank on behalf of Public Works this proclamation. It is truly an honor to be part of this organization and work with these 1100 people that I would say are fully committed not only to the council priority by the mayor's priorities but also the stakeholders priorities and be able to mix all these priorities together and come up with public works priority which is to create a smart city meaning a sustainable city a city that provides mobility in a safe way and attractive city resiliency and also a process to be the most transparent process that we can deliver. Somebody says I was reading this book the other day. Somebody says that the public space is the the visible face of society. And I do believe that. I think that that's how we judge cities when we go around the world and come back. I to talk a little bit spend a little bit of time talking about the ten employees that we're honoring tonight because I think it's very important to mention exactly what these employees have been working and being part of. Jason Rediker from Capital Management recently designed two very critical storm sewer projects. One of them have been in neighborhood. And the other one is at first and university which is under construction in your district. Chloe Thompson from Finance Administration. She is one of our first black built from the academy.

Jess Contreras from St Monans Jessie has been with ST Maintenance for ten years. He made it a personal goal to learn all areas of his department and has been very successful in doing . Jesse takes pride in the fact that he loves to share his knowledge with other co workers and recently he was promoted to equipment operator a specialist. Now in April 2014. Runs Smart from Traffic Engineering Services. He's responsible for replacing all the crosswalk in the south east quadrant of the city. I'm sorry south west quadrant of the city.

Moon enjoys working with the wastewater lab. She's always willing to go above and beyond respect patient and responsibilities to ensure that the work in the lab is done accurately in support the Mayor's 2020 sustainability goals. I want to thank the staff and the 1100 employee that provides work for the city every day. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Say. Hey we're moving along. Resolutions. Madam Secretary will you please read the resolutions.\",\n          \"Communications. Do we have any communications? None. Mr. President. We have two proclamations this evening. Councilman Hernan will you please read Proclamation 1089? Yes Mr. President I'm excited to read Proclamation 1089 honoring the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and its contribution to building the capacity of our beloved Denver Public Library. Whereas the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has established itself as a 21st century Andrew Carnegie for public libraries and the people and communities they serve. And. WHEREAS The Gates Foundation was a pioneer in understanding the risk of the digital divide and the importance of digital inclusion. And. Whereas The Gates Foundation challenged public libraries to become technology leaders and provided millions of dollars to help libraries become go to resources and trusted guides in an increasingly digital world. And. Whereas The Gates Foundation provided a significant investment to develop EDGE a national technology benchmarking system created to ensure that public libraries have the technology to meet today's needs and the promise of tomorrow. And. Whereas with its commitment to ensuring that all people have access to the opportunities they need to succeed in school and life the Gates Foundation has had a profound impact in communities across the country. And. WHEREAS the work of the Gates Foundation has enhanced the capacity value and power of public libraries as vital community assets. And. WHEREAS The Denver Public Library and the residents of Denver have benefited from the vision commitment and support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation . Now therefore the April claim by the Council the city and county of Denver Section one that the Council recognizes and appreciates the importance of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for its groundbreaking work in support of public libraries and the role of Denver Public Library as an essential community resource to support community goals and meet the diverse educational needs of our residents from birth through senior years and ensure equal access to the opportunities of the 21st century. Section two that the Clerk of the city and county of Denver shall test and fix the seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation and that a copy be transmitted to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Thank you. Councilman Ernie your motion to adopt. Thank you Mr. President. I move that proclamation 1089 be adopted. It has been moved. And second it comments by members of Council Councilman Herndon. Thank you Mr. President. I I cannot express in words how important libraries were important to me when I was growing up as a kid. And my favorite book or I should say my favorite series was the Hardy Boy series. And I remember reading all of those. And during the summer I would read a number of books and I would get pizzas from that from Pizza Hut back in Kansas City. And it's interesting now as we become more technology technologically savvy there's this belief that certain institutions are no longer needed. And sometimes people think that about libraries. I believe that our libraries are more value than are more important than than they've ever been because there is a very real and it was mentioned in this proclamation digital divide or that there's a particular segment of the community that don't have the access to technology that a lot of people take for granted. And that gap that stop gap for one is our libraries for our communities of lower income for our seniors that people don't think about the way they connected to the world. And their libraries are also community resources where people come for classes resume building job search job searches. Our libraries are more important than ever. And you see that when you think about great programs that we do Summer of Reading where Northeast Denver always wins by the way. And we also have the great success on the West Side I'm sure Councilman Lopez and talk about the Corky Gonzales Library and how successful it has been for that community that was built a couple of years ago and has been a huge success. it's vital that we continue to make sure that our our libraries our technology staffs and have a great asset to support our community. We have a great library in Montebello. They opened up their idea lab for young people to come and let their imaginations run wild. And our libraries are that key our key place to do that. I'm thankful for the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation for recognizing that. I applaud Denver Public Library for all the work that it does to make sure all of our residents have access to it and the great work that they do each and every day. I appreciate my colleagues to support this. And thank you Mr. President. Thank you Councilman Herndon. Seeing no other comments madam secretary. Raquel Herndon i. Cashman's I can eat. Lopez. All new Ortega. SUSSMAN Black. Clark Hi. Espinosa Hi. Flynn I. Gilmore I. Mr. President. I. Please close the voting. Announce the results. Lights flashing 13 eyes. 13 eyes proclamation 1089 has passed has been dubbed it Councilman Herndon. Is there anyone you want to bring up? We do. Our esteemed librarian I understand is traveling but we do have other members from Denver Public Library that would love to come forward and accept this proclamation. Thank you. Members of City Council we do appreciate the proclamation as a way that we can express to the Gates Foundation how much we've appreciated the investment that they've made in the technology infrastructure of the Denver Public Library. For decades now they have been investing across the city or across the country and in our city to make sure that we have been able to bridge the digital divide as much as possible. In a budget meeting we had earlier this month we talked about what we still have some of those Gates funds left and we're using them to purchase mobile hotspots that are checked out of all by anybody with a library card can come get on the hold list. They're very popular and check one out and take it home that they can use that technology from the convenience of their own home and not be limited by library facilities and library hours. Last check we had 300 people waiting on the hold list for the hundreds of library hotspots we have now. And we're going to be buying hundreds more with that money before the end of the year. thank you. Thank you. And thank you Councilman Herndon.

Metro has contracted with the Long Beach Police Department to for the first time be able to patrol our own metro system.\\nThe blue line here in Long Beach beginning this summer.\\nThe Long Beach Police Department will be transitioning into full jurisdictional control of the Long Beach Blue Line and all eight stations as as the the route between each station across the entire city of Long Beach from old from north Long Beach all the way through until the downtown.\\nI want to note that this is an incredibly significant moment for the city of Long Beach.\\nPersonnel added to the Long Beach Police Department.\\nAnd it's not every day that this council will get to vote on adding 30 new police officers to the Long Beach Police Department.\\nThese 30 officers will make up what will be a Long Beach metro detail for the city of Long Beach.\\nWe know I certainly know as a councilman that there are a lot of challenges on the blue line.\\nThere's both a problem of safety and a problem of perception of safety when it comes to the Long Beach blue line.\\nAnd I know that our Long Beach police officers our chief are going to do a fantastic job of not patrolling the blue line but the synergy that will be created as are patrolling the areas up and down.\\nThe blue line is going to be something that is going to be pretty great to see.\\nAnd I also ask the chief to invite his team that helped work on this.\\nAnd I want to congratulate our chief of police for his leadership on this issue.\\nAnd let's give our chief of police and his team a big round of applause for their work.\\nThank you Mr. Mayor and members of the City Council.\\nAnd it's not every day that we can talk about adding approximately 30 officers to our police department.\\nBut we're turning it around between Measure three and this blue line contract if you guys approve it tonight what an excellent opportunity for the city.\\nEverybody wanted the Long Beach Police Department to acquire this contract.\\nAnd throughout this process I was contacted by several people who worked at Metro who continuously stated that the the request from the city of Long Beach was much better than the one received from the city of Los Angeles and the sheriff's department.\\nAnd they'll be in charge of the daily operation of what I think is going to be one of the best policed transit systems anywhere in the country.\\nthank you very much.\\nThank you Chief.\\nI wanted to also think I wanted to thank I asked Sharon Weisman who's behind me to come down.\\nSharon is my new transportation deputy metro and she spent a lot of time working with all the other board members and staffs of all the other board members to ensure that they have the information and to me to ensure that we would end up with a unanimous vote which is which is what we did.\\nSharon I wanted to thank you too.\\nThank you for your work on this.\\nAnd let me go to let me go to the Long Beach City Council Councilmember Pearce.\\nI could have gone after Councilmember Pearce but I wanted to take this opportunity Chief to congratulate you and your department on this new responsibility.\\nI think it's great for the city of Long Beach.\\nI think it's more of a congratulations to the residents in the riders of the Blue Line.\\nYes. Because this this this agreement will make our blue line I believe much safer.\\nI think one one key point that was raised that was pretty compelling is that how response times will be improved from having local police department patrolling and assigned to the blue line.\\nI also want to remark on our mayor and Mayor Garcia and his his work.\\nEarly work on the on the MTA board on this this agreement came about I think he was he had been on the board for maybe a month a little over that.\\nAnd for those of you who know me for a long time I've been a strong advocate for a Long Beach having a seat at the MTA board.\\nAnd I think that there are still great announcements ahead of us and the best is still yet to come.\\nThank you.\\nYes. Thank you chief and to all of you for being here and for your hard work.\\nI know the next five years is going to be we're going to have a great start.\\nBut I do believe that having our own Long Beach Police Department enforcing on the blue line and hopefully being there of course as a positive element to the riders along the blue line especially when they come into the Grand Prix and they're coming here for amazing events that they'll be able to see.\\nOur own police department there is going to be fantastic and thanks for Mayor and Supervisor Horn as .\\nthanks again.\\nI do want to congratulate you guys and congratulate the mayor and everybody that worked hard on this.\\nIt was hard to speak for only a minute but the one thing that I think was enlightening is that our response times are going to change.\\nAs Councilmember Austin mentioned I think it's what 7 to 10 minutes difference which can be important for people riding the metro riding our blue line.\\nI listened to the comments that were made at Metro that day and I want to say that I'm proud to have our PD on our metro line.\\nI think that the training that we're doing the equity lens that we're talking about the investment that you guys are making in the community to be able to have that throughout our entire city on our metro is exciting.\\nI wanted to make sure that I mentioned how proud I am of all the work that you guys are doing.\\nBut there is going to be a process that we're following where Metro wants to do a different job or they want to approach fare evasion in a very different way.\\nI don't know Justin but thank you for the information guys and congratulations.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nThank you very much Mr. Mayor.\\nOne of the things that we've been telling the community is this is this is a great development for the blue line in our ability to enforce in those areas.\\nBut in addition to that it's going to relieve pressure citywide for the police department.\\nWe're going to have to work up to those numbers of course.\\nAnd when Metro needs help we respond we currently do with any contract that our police department serves now.\\nthank you.\\nThank you.\\nThank you Mayor.\\nAnd I will congratulate you Mayor on your efforts on making sure that this happened.\\nThank you.\\nYes thank you Mayor.\\nAlso I want to congratulate everyone who has been able to make this contract happen.\\nBut most of all I want to thank the mayor for you and your hard work and efforts on the board being a board member.\\nAnd thank you too for the Long Beach Police Department able to embark on this process.\\npublic safety the metro line is important I think to all of us and the residents who rely on public transportation and they deserve to feel very safe and free.\\nthank you guys again and keep up the good work.\\nWill there be a pass through for those that information for for Long Beach PD on the metro train?\\nWill people have to contact the sheriff's department to get to Long Beach PD or will there be something specific for for us for for our city?\\nThank you.\\nThank you Mr. Mayor.\\nA number of people in the county did not think this was going to happen.\\nLong Beach doesn't connect the blue line.\\nThey're going to see that Long Beach PD is from that Compton station you'll have some seamless connection there to make it a little bit less forum for our local riders.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nAs I said last week there's probably 3 to 4 people none of which are in this room that has more experience with the blue line in mass transit.\\nThe Long Beach Police can't do that.\\nAll our visitors coming to Long Beach need that are the restaurant patrons the Grand Prix people.\\nThe delivery comes to Long Beach.\\nAnd when your neighbors ask why the police aren't there tell them they're on the blue line.\\nThank you.\\nAgain I want to thank you for making the personal trek down to Mexico to speak out against the city hiring 30 more police officers you did a week ago as .\\nI think it's a great opportunity to integrate the police department have them follow the traffic that comes in and out of the blue line and have more control over the city.\\nThank you.\\nI don't know if they're going to take the the blue line to a hotel a five star restaurant.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\n. Thank you.\\nAnd congratulations to Long Beach Police Department.\",\n          \"Thank you Councilmember.\\nCouncilmember CdeBaca go ahead with your questions on.\\nBut I do have a question.\\nI have a few questions to list for you to take back.\\nBut my main question here is the dates.\\nCan you explain the the contract change and the date and what exactly this is funding?\\n. Thank you for your question.\\nOne is for our great program and the second is for our state judicial gun probation.\\nthere are two FTE for probation officers that do work in our schools.\\nOur great program to date has served over 9000 students and our successful rates of kids who enter into the school and maybe they're possessing a gun.\\n. great question.\\nYes yes great question.\\nThey also provide partnerships with community organizations to help with food.\\nthis gun probation officer is a Denver thing.\\nIs this something that we've always had or what makes this gun prevention or what makes this probation officer different than all the rest of them?\\nAnd what's different about our program is that we we are and this is what the Grant Network is in partnership with community partners.\\nAnd these three providers they work with our probation officer probation chief probation officer Sean Cone.\\nBecause understanding that and it's a great question with the struggles and not being in schools anymore.\\nAnd while we're advocating for new safety programs and grit to take a more elevated role in our schools is because we are looking at the whole system or looking at the whole the whole person rather.\\nthis is on first reading but some of the questions that I'm looking for answers for is a specific breakdown on how the dollars are going to be used.\\nAnd as we move officers out of schools I think it's important for us to be very conscious of how the city uses officers with young people and this is one of those contracts that does deals directly with our young people.\\nBut I got two or three questions.\\nAnd the explanation on how we're operating in a time of COVID without the access to the schools that the great program relies on?\\nAnd we were considering bringing or separating these two contracts after July 1st and doing an RFP process given that we've been operating these contracts since 2011 of doing a competitive bidding process and looking at other community partners that could come in and do the work in partnership with the state.\\nAnd that was the goal to separate the great contract and the gun court probation manager and we were planning on doing that after July 1st.\\nI think your question.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nMichael following Councilwoman say to Bucky's questions and follow up you said that this would cover two FTE positions.\\nAnd are the probation officers if if we weren't in a COVID situation are those individuals in the physical school building?\\nAnd they work with the they work with the principal to make sure that there is supervision inside the school and outside the school.\\ngreat question.\\nAnd if a young person has a gun or is involved in a crime then that would potentially require some level of supervision inside of the school.\\nas a follow up I would a little bit more information about exactly how these two FTE positions interface with both Denver public school students and the school personnel.\\nIf the 75 000 is added in and to councilwoman say to Baca's earlier question about the 2.5 million that was possibly going to Eckerd that adds up to almost $3.5 million both through workforce and through this agreement with the Colorado State Judicial Department.\\nI think there's a lot of support in the community to make sure that organizations can build that capacity as we begin to phase out old systems and asking new questions about that.\\nAnd I'd to get a little bit more information because as much work as the GRID program does in our community since I was elected in 2015 I have attended seven vigils in the Montebello and our community specifically.\\nAnd I want to make sure that we're evaluating it fully and that you're providing all that information to counsel that we can ask good questions.\\nThank you.\\nGreat questions from my colleagues.\\nit's helpful as I'm looking at it some of my questions were asked about dollars that are going to community groups from other budget items.\\nTo Councilwoman Gilmore's question it sounds this money's already spent.\\nTruthfully this contract is the work is already ending.\\nBut the other question I had was in terms of other prevention efforts grasp or other community based organizations I believe we are funding as .\\nand I can I ask a naive question is the difference that this particular program we're here to talk about tonight is for youth who are already justice involved.\\nThat that that answers my question.\\nThe other question I have is you this is ending this contract but you also mentioned our of PS and whatnot.\\nWe have Denver youth safety programs that is in schools today or currently they do pre-arrest diversion programs.\\nAnd that these are programs that are designed to in that school to gyp school to prison pipeline.\\nAnd if we're going to remove SRO as out then could we look at these type of restorative justice practices inside of our schools with community partners because you safety programs they have community partners that they do work with as .\\nAnd the answer to that question is yes.\\nAnd we're going to start we're a part of that stakeholder gathering process that Suzanne Cordova is going to be working with to provide some expertize and also to begin to look at what's the future of of our relationship.\\nI think I stand and supportive of argue safety programs office.\\nThe work that they did at North High School and West Campus were phenomenal.\\nI believe in that program and I think that that can help replace that SRO role that historically was in school.\\nThank you Councilmember.\\nSee no other questions or comments on this one.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

Thank you Councilwoman Robb. Your motion to adopt. Thank you Madam President. I move to adopt proclamation 441. Thank you very much. It's been moved and seconded. Comments by Council Councilwoman Robb. I always enjoy doing this proclamation. I think it's wonderful that when street sweeping starts again and when we get busy on our street paving program when even more people are biking and walking on our sidewalks and bikeways that we celebrate the. People who make all of that happen and I'm glad to do that tonight. I am very proud of the employees of the year. That is an outstanding achievement. And I'm saying this to anyone who is here or is listening because there are 1100 employees in public works in there are only ten of you. that's huge. Maybe this is making your career as Jim McIntyre talked about there many things that the department does. And I know many of my colleagues will probably want to chime in but I don't think a day goes by that we are not calling public works. Talking with Nancy Cohn. Talking with George Delaney. The proclamation lists a lot of this. Do I need to mention also the bond program and all the implementation of that program? I'm happy to do this. And I want to give a special nod to Cindy Patton who works in my district all the time. I know she works in many of yours. She should be cloned. I don't know some of the other recipients as as I know Cindy. But if you're as amazing as she is you should be clone too. And then we could have more public works employees which would be good. thank you Madam President. And I know my colleagues will support this proclamation. Thank you Councilwoman Robb. Councilwoman Kennish. Thank you Madam President. And I want to thank my colleague Councilwoman Robb for congratulating and recognizing this department as a self-described policy wonk. Before I got elected I thought I would be focusing on the sexy departments in the city be about economic development and human services. And I have been surprised by how integral the work that I have done to fight poverty build communities has brought me working closely with your staff. And I'll give my quick highlight list. Regional Policy. we are passionate on this council about pedestrian safety and walkability and multimodal transportation in the regional conversation. Sometimes those things are harder to achieve as folks want to build more lanes on roads. And I rely closely on the policy team and some of the experts in the public works department to think about how we talk about those issues regionally and make the whole region work together. And you guys staff us at a on a daily basis probably. And that work my work to create a open space. Caswell Monteiro and I work together in an area of Globeville. And we think of it as a park which is something very sexy but there's much public infrastructure in terms of stormwater and in terms of even getting down to curb and gutter which I'm sure you're going to help me pay for. But those pieces having public works at the table to create an open space out of a blighted area and all the way through the other pieces of the city's work. I've been surprised and delighted by what I've learned from working with you by what I've gained by having you at the tables that you've been willing to participate in. And I thank you for that broad reaching approach which isn't how do we build or maintain infrastructure but how do we achieve goals for people in ways that infrastructure can support them? And that's that's cool. And I appreciate it. And I know it extends to all of the divisions that I represented today with the priorities. thank you. Thank you Councilwoman Carnation. Councilman Neville if you don't mind I want to riff off of that. I'll give you the last word. I'm not exactly a policy wonk but I am a city nerd. And Public Works gives me the opportunity to talk about things that bother my friends sometimes street paving and sidewalks and traffic lights and urban drainage. I can talk a lot about urban drainage and gutters and sewers and and finally they have taught me how to talk trash. And I could talk trash in a very polite way. And I have enjoyed working with public works much. It feeds my inner nerd . And this is -deserved. Councilman Levitt. Thank you Madam President. Does that make me a policy punk? I don't mean perhaps. Going with the theme. This along with the the hepatitis C proclamation is a is a perennial but one that I'm always happy to see because it's an opportunity to celebrate the department and its employees who don't often get celebrated. Public Works is is the atlas that holds up the world. we spend a lot of time being excited about the world but we don't give proper credit to the atlas that holds it up and public works does that in. A thousand different ways that are rarely recognized. it's great to have public works week and to be able to recognize public works for all they do. It's the the bottom of the food pyramid. Nobody gets excited about the whatever the hell is on the bottom of the food pyramid but nobody gets excited about it. But it's it's the pyramid that holds up the rest of it. And that's what public works does for us holds up our world. And thank you for doing it. Thank you Councilman. It looks Councilman Lopez going to get the last word. Oh great. Thank you. I I also wanted to to publicly thank the Department of Public Works. You do much in our city and I know we are constantly calling the department and in public works is the department of many different departments. It is the the quintessential bare bones minimum of the city. If there is one thing we do it is the work that we do in public works. And if there's one thing that best defines the role of government in the whole purpose of government to do the things for the many that we can possibly do for the individual . Public works and public works achieves that . If you drive down a street you may hit some potholes but chances are in Denver you don't. Why? Because they do such a good job. They do such a good job. They did it in a district that I represent. And for 25 years. Some people may laugh about it but for 25 years nobody had touched it. And because of the leadership in public works because of the men and women in public works you won't find a pothole in Villa Park. You won't find a pothole in some parts of Westwood now. And instead you find neighborhoods that look built that are created and that are built to last. And you see bike lanes on Morrison Road and Knox Core ? You see different things that are happening in our city. And this is all done by the hands of the people who call the city home who happen to work in their public works. I happened to work on West Alaska Place in the Westwood neighborhood while we were paving. We go out every year and think folks are paying pass out Gatorade and and water. And lo and behold one of the people who was paving the street lived on that street and grew up on that street. That's what makes this department special ? This year we may talk trash once in a while but a manager got an AHA. You run a very good shop with a great manager at his helm. thank you. Thank you Councilman Lopez Councilwoman Monteiro. And thank you Madam President. I also want to take the opportunity to extend my appreciation. I wish I knew all 1100 employees. But here's what I do know that public works does everything from Keep Denver Beautiful this far as graffiti graffiti removal all the way to major projects. I'm very mindful of the role that Public Works played in the redevelopment of Denver Union Station and the work that you're doing currently regarding I-70 and the National Western Stock Show. And we couldn't we couldn't do wouldn't be responsive if we didn't have the help of solid waste. Also permitting and enforcement have worked with a lot of people their street maintenance. And then of course Nancy I have an inbox of a lot of emails that you and I have I'm going to have to start deleting some of those. I also want to extend my thank you to host Cornell for all of the work that you do and that and for your steadfast steadfast leadership. And also to George Delaney who you're there when Jose is away from the helm. And I appreciate that. congratulations again. Let me see if I got these names . Jason Chloe Adrian Luis Jeremy Cindy Patrick and Ron. I hope I got everybody's name. Thank you. Thank you Counselor Monteiro. All . Looks we're ready for the vote. Rob I. Shepherd I. But I. Herndon I can eat lemon. Lopez All . Monteiro I love it. Hi Ortega. Hi. Madam President. I am close to voting out the results. 11 eyes. 11 eyes. The proclamation is adopted Councilman Roberts or somebody would to call up to the podium. Yes Madam President I expected my colleagues to support this but I hope no one out there was insulted with some of the comments. I would to call up the interesting sexy cool and strong executive director of the Public Works Department which is an interesting sexy cool and strong department. Good one. Councilwoman Rob. Cook. I'm single network secretary director of Public Works and I want to thank on behalf of Public Works this proclamation. It is truly an honor to be part of this organization and work with these 1100 people that I would say are fully committed not only to the council priority by the mayor's priorities but also the stakeholders priorities and be able to mix all these priorities together and come up with public works priority which is to create a smart city meaning a sustainable city a city that provides mobility in a safe way and attractive city resiliency and also a process to be the most transparent process that we can deliver. Somebody says I was reading this book the other day. Somebody says that the public space is the the visible face of society. And I do believe that. I think that that's how we judge cities when we go around the world and come back. I to talk a little bit spend a little bit of time talking about the ten employees that we're honoring tonight because I think it's very important to mention exactly what these employees have been working and being part of. Jason Rediker from Capital Management recently designed two very critical storm sewer projects. One of them have been in neighborhood. And the other one is at first and university which is under construction in your district. Chloe Thompson from Finance Administration. She is one of our first black built from the academy. She has worked very hard to improve and develop new models for for the financial track in streamlining contracts contracting and putting in place a more efficient procurement process. Adrian Goldman from Fleet Management. Adrian was very close with our fleet technicians downloading software that helps to better diagnose vehicles and speed up the repair process. Lewis Gardner From of Way Enforcement in permitting Lewis is a very diligent vehicle investigator who goes above and beyond to assist not only the public but also the the in the agency. He volunteers to maintain city's vehicle inventory and has taken the lead role a role a role in making sure that the motors workshop is free of hazardous materials and and mark problems. Jeremy Hammer from of way services. He's our lead on floodplain issues. He's responsible for very complex flood floodplains and drainage issues.

Patrick Quintana. From way. Paddy squeal automated barrel truck driver who continues to contribute to agency success. Paddy is a member of Solid Waste Eating a member of the Supervisory Mentor Program. This is a very successful program in which we are training our staff to become supervisors and at back has been instrumental in mentoring some of these future supervisors. Jess Contreras from St Monans Jessie has been with ST Maintenance for ten years. He made it a personal goal to learn all areas of his department and has been very successful in doing . Jesse takes pride in the fact that he loves to share his knowledge with other co workers and recently he was promoted to equipment operator a specialist. Now in April 2014. Runs Smart from Traffic Engineering Services. He's responsible for replacing all the crosswalk in the south east quadrant of the city. I'm sorry south west quadrant of the city. He has replaced replace over 75% of the criss cross work with permanent marking since 2011. And he's the person responsible for the green stripes that you see on St Patrick's Day and purpose stripes for the rookie opening. And last but not least this one being from wastewater management. Moon enjoys working with the wastewater lab. She's always willing to go above and beyond respect patient and responsibilities to ensure that the work in the lab is done accurately in support the Mayor's 2020 sustainability goals. I want to thank the staff and the 1100 employee that provides work for the city every day. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Say. Hey we're moving along. Resolutions. Madam Secretary will you please read the resolutions.\",\n          \"Communications. Do we have any communications? None. Mr. President. We have two proclamations this evening. Councilman Hernan will you please read Proclamation 1089? Yes Mr. President I'm excited to read Proclamation 1089 honoring the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and its contribution to building the capacity of our beloved Denver Public Library. Whereas the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has established itself as a 21st century Andrew Carnegie for public libraries and the people and communities they serve. And. WHEREAS The Gates Foundation was a pioneer in understanding the risk of the digital divide and the importance of digital inclusion. And. Whereas The Gates Foundation challenged public libraries to become technology leaders and provided millions of dollars to help libraries become go to resources and trusted guides in an increasingly digital world. And. Whereas The Gates Foundation provided a significant investment to develop EDGE a national technology benchmarking system created to ensure that public libraries have the technology to meet today's needs and the promise of tomorrow. And. Whereas with its commitment to ensuring that all people have access to the opportunities they need to succeed in school and life the Gates Foundation has had a profound impact in communities across the country. And. WHEREAS the work of the Gates Foundation has enhanced the capacity value and power of public libraries as vital community assets. And. WHEREAS The Denver Public Library and the residents of Denver have benefited from the vision commitment and support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation . Now therefore the April claim by the Council the city and county of Denver Section one that the Council recognizes and appreciates the importance of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for its groundbreaking work in support of public libraries and the role of Denver Public Library as an essential community resource to support community goals and meet the diverse educational needs of our residents from birth through senior years and ensure equal access to the opportunities of the 21st century. Section two that the Clerk of the city and county of Denver shall test and fix the seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation and that a copy be transmitted to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Thank you. Councilman Ernie your motion to adopt. Thank you Mr. President. I move that proclamation 1089 be adopted. It has been moved. And second it comments by members of Council Councilman Herndon. Thank you Mr. President. I I cannot express in words how important libraries were important to me when I was growing up as a kid. And my favorite book or I should say my favorite series was the Hardy Boy series. And I remember reading all of those. And during the summer I would read a number of books and I would get pizzas from that from Pizza Hut back in Kansas City. And it's interesting now as we become more technology technologically savvy there's this belief that certain institutions are no longer needed. And sometimes people think that about libraries. I believe that our libraries are more value than are more important than than they've ever been because there is a very real and it was mentioned in this proclamation digital divide or that there's a particular segment of the community that don't have the access to technology that a lot of people take for granted. And that gap that stop gap for one is our libraries for our communities of lower income for our seniors that people don't think about the way they connected to the world. And their libraries are also community resources where people come for classes resume building job search job searches. Our libraries are more important than ever. And you see that when you think about great programs that we do Summer of Reading where Northeast Denver always wins by the way. And we also have the great success on the West Side I'm sure Councilman Lopez and talk about the Corky Gonzales Library and how successful it has been for that community that was built a couple of years ago and has been a huge success. it's vital that we continue to make sure that our our libraries our technology staffs and have a great asset to support our community. We have a great library in Montebello. They opened up their idea lab for young people to come and let their imaginations run wild. And our libraries are that key our key place to do that. I'm thankful for the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation for recognizing that. I applaud Denver Public Library for all the work that it does to make sure all of our residents have access to it and the great work that they do each and every day. I appreciate my colleagues to support this. And thank you Mr. President. Thank you Councilman Herndon. Seeing no other comments madam secretary. Raquel Herndon i. Cashman's I can eat. Lopez. All new Ortega. SUSSMAN Black. Clark Hi. Espinosa Hi. Flynn I. Gilmore I. Mr. President. I. Please close the voting. Announce the results. Lights flashing 13 eyes. 13 eyes proclamation 1089 has passed has been dubbed it Councilman Herndon. Is there anyone you want to bring up? We do. Our esteemed librarian I understand is traveling but we do have other members from Denver Public Library that would love to come forward and accept this proclamation. Thank you. Members of City Council we do appreciate the proclamation as a way that we can express to the Gates Foundation how much we've appreciated the investment that they've made in the technology infrastructure of the Denver Public Library. For decades now they have been investing across the city or across the country and in our city to make sure that we have been able to bridge the digital divide as much as possible. In a budget meeting we had earlier this month we talked about what we still have some of those Gates funds left and we're using them to purchase mobile hotspots that are checked out of all by anybody with a library card can come get on the hold list. They're very popular and check one out and take it home that they can use that technology from the convenience of their own home and not be limited by library facilities and library hours.

Think you're going to make some some comments and then I might turn this over to our our chief of police to also make some some comments.\\nI want to first of all obviously thank the Lombard City Council for their unanimous support of doing this contract with with L.A. Metro.\\nAs we as we now know L.A. Metro has contracted with the Long Beach Police Department to for the first time be able to patrol our own metro system.\\nThe blue line here in Long Beach beginning this summer.\\nThe Long Beach Police Department will be transitioning into full jurisdictional control of the Long Beach Blue Line and all eight stations as as the the route between each station across the entire city of Long Beach from old from north Long Beach all the way through until the downtown.\\nI want to note that this is an incredibly significant moment for the city of Long Beach.\\nPersonnel added to the Long Beach Police Department.\\nAnd it's not every day that this council will get to vote on adding 30 new police officers to the Long Beach Police Department.\\nThese 30 officers will make up what will be a Long Beach metro detail for the city of Long Beach.\\nWe know I certainly know as a councilman that there are a lot of challenges on the blue line.\\nThere's both a problem of safety and a problem of perception of safety when it comes to the Long Beach blue line.\\nAnd I know that our Long Beach police officers our chief are going to do a fantastic job of not patrolling the blue line but the synergy that will be created as are patrolling the areas up and down.\\nThe blue line is going to be something that is going to be pretty great to see.\\nAnd I also ask the chief to invite his team that helped work on this.\\nAnd I want to congratulate our chief of police for his leadership on this issue.\\nAnd let's give our chief of police and his team a big round of applause for their work.\\nThank you Mr. Mayor and members of the City Council.\\nAnd it's not every day that we can talk about adding approximately 30 officers to our police department.\\nBut we're turning it around between Measure three and this blue line contract if you guys approve it tonight what an excellent opportunity for the city.\\nEverybody wanted the Long Beach Police Department to acquire this contract.\\nAnd throughout this process I was contacted by several people who worked at Metro who continuously stated that the the request from the city of Long Beach was much better than the one received from the city of Los Angeles and the sheriff's department.\\nAnd they'll be in charge of the daily operation of what I think is going to be one of the best policed transit systems anywhere in the country.\\nthank you very much.\\nThank you Chief.\\nI wanted to also think I wanted to thank I asked Sharon Weisman who's behind me to come down.\\nSharon is my new transportation deputy metro and she spent a lot of time working with all the other board members and staffs of all the other board members to ensure that they have the information and to me to ensure that we would end up with a unanimous vote which is which is what we did.\\nSharon I wanted to thank you too.\\nThank you for your work on this.\\nAnd let me go to let me go to the Long Beach City Council Councilmember Pearce.\\nI could have gone after Councilmember Pearce but I wanted to take this opportunity Chief to congratulate you and your department on this new responsibility.\\nI think it's great for the city of Long Beach.\\nI think it's more of a congratulations to the residents in the riders of the Blue Line.\\nYes. Because this this this agreement will make our blue line I believe much safer.\\nI think one one key point that was raised that was pretty compelling is that how response times will be improved from having local police department patrolling and assigned to the blue line.\\nI also want to remark on our mayor and Mayor Garcia and his his work.\\nEarly work on the on the MTA board on this this agreement came about I think he was he had been on the board for maybe a month a little over that.\\nAnd for those of you who know me for a long time I've been a strong advocate for a Long Beach having a seat at the MTA board.\\nAnd I think that there are still great announcements ahead of us and the best is still yet to come.\\nThank you.\\nYes. Thank you chief and to all of you for being here and for your hard work.\\nI know the next five years is going to be we're going to have a great start.\\nBut I do believe that having our own Long Beach Police Department enforcing on the blue line and hopefully being there of course as a positive element to the riders along the blue line especially when they come into the Grand Prix and they're coming here for amazing events that they'll be able to see.\\nOur own police department there is going to be fantastic and thanks for Mayor and Supervisor Horn as .\\nthanks again.\\nI do want to congratulate you guys and congratulate the mayor and everybody that worked hard on this.\\nIt was hard to speak for only a minute but the one thing that I think was enlightening is that our response times are going to change.\\nAs Councilmember Austin mentioned I think it's what 7 to 10 minutes difference which can be important for people riding the metro riding our blue line.\\nI listened to the comments that were made at Metro that day and I want to say that I'm proud to have our PD on our metro line.\\nI think that the training that we're doing the equity lens that we're talking about the investment that you guys are making in the community to be able to have that throughout our entire city on our metro is exciting.\\nI wanted to make sure that I mentioned how proud I am of all the work that you guys are doing.\\nBut there is going to be a process that we're following where Metro wants to do a different job or they want to approach fare evasion in a very different way.\\nI don't know Justin but thank you for the information guys and congratulations.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nThank you very much Mr. Mayor.\\nOne of the things that we've been telling the community is this is this is a great development for the blue line in our ability to enforce in those areas.\\nBut in addition to that it's going to relieve pressure citywide for the police department.\\nWe're going to have to work up to those numbers of course.\\nAnd when Metro needs help we respond we currently do with any contract that our police department serves now.\\nthank you.\\nThank you.\\nThank you Mayor.\\nAnd I will congratulate you Mayor on your efforts on making sure that this happened.\\nThank you.\\nYes thank you Mayor.\\nAlso I want to congratulate everyone who has been able to make this contract happen.\\nBut most of all I want to thank the mayor for you and your hard work and efforts on the board being a board member.\\nAnd thank you too for the Long Beach Police Department able to embark on this process.\\npublic safety the metro line is important I think to all of us and the residents who rely on public transportation and they deserve to feel very safe and free.\\nthank you guys again and keep up the good work.\\nWill there be a pass through for those that information for for Long Beach PD on the metro train?\\nWill people have to contact the sheriff's department to get to Long Beach PD or will there be something specific for for us for for our city?\\nThank you.\\nThank you Mr. Mayor.\\nA number of people in the county did not think this was going to happen.\\nLong Beach doesn't connect the blue line.\\nThey're going to see that Long Beach PD is from that Compton station you'll have some seamless connection there to make it a little bit less forum for our local riders.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nAs I said last week there's probably 3 to 4 people none of which are in this room that has more experience with the blue line in mass transit.\\nThe Long Beach Police can't do that.\\nAll our visitors coming to Long Beach need that are the restaurant patrons the Grand Prix people.\\nThe delivery comes to Long Beach.\\nAnd when your neighbors ask why the police aren't there tell them they're on the blue line.\\nThank you.\\nAgain I want to thank you for making the personal trek down to Mexico to speak out against the city hiring 30 more police officers you did a week ago as .\\nI think it's a great opportunity to integrate the police department have them follow the traffic that comes in and out of the blue line and have more control over the city.\\nThank you.\\nI don't know if they're going to take the the blue line to a hotel a five star restaurant.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\n. Thank you.\\nAnd congratulations to Long Beach Police Department.\",\n          \"Thank you Councilmember.\\nCouncilmember CdeBaca go ahead with your questions on.\\nBut I do have a question.\\nI have a few questions to list for you to take back.\\nBut my main question here is the dates.\\nCan you explain the the contract change and the date and what exactly this is funding?\\n. Thank you for your question.\\nOne is for our great program and the second is for our state judicial gun probation.\\nthere are two FTE for probation officers that do work in our schools.\\nOur great program to date has served over 9000 students and our successful rates of kids who enter into the school and maybe they're possessing a gun.\\n. great question.\\nYes yes great question.\\nThey also provide partnerships with community organizations to help with food.\\nthis gun probation officer is a Denver thing.\\nIs this something that we've always had or what makes this gun prevention or what makes this probation officer different than all the rest of them?\\nAnd what's different about our program is that we we are and this is what the Grant Network is in partnership with community partners.\\nAnd these three providers they work with our probation officer probation chief probation officer Sean Cone.\\nBecause understanding that and it's a great question with the struggles and not being in schools anymore.\\nAnd while we're advocating for new safety programs and grit to take a more elevated role in our schools is because we are looking at the whole system or looking at the whole the whole person rather.\\nthis is on first reading but some of the questions that I'm looking for answers for is a specific breakdown on how the dollars are going to be used.\\nAnd as we move officers out of schools I think it's important for us to be very conscious of how the city uses officers with young people and this is one of those contracts that does deals directly with our young people.\\nBut I got two or three questions.\\nAnd the explanation on how we're operating in a time of COVID without the access to the schools that the great program relies on?\\nAnd we were considering bringing or separating these two contracts after July 1st and doing an RFP process given that we've been operating these contracts since 2011 of doing a competitive bidding process and looking at other community partners that could come in and do the work in partnership with the state.\\nAnd that was the goal to separate the great contract and the gun court probation manager and we were planning on doing that after July 1st.\\nI think your question.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nMichael following Councilwoman say to Bucky's questions and follow up you said that this would cover two FTE positions.\\nAnd are the probation officers if if we weren't in a COVID situation are those individuals in the physical school building?\\nAnd they work with the they work with the principal to make sure that there is supervision inside the school and outside the school.\\ngreat question.\\nAnd if a young person has a gun or is involved in a crime then that would potentially require some level of supervision inside of the school.\\nas a follow up I would a little bit more information about exactly how these two FTE positions interface with both Denver public school students and the school personnel.\\nIf the 75 000 is added in and to councilwoman say to Baca's earlier question about the 2.5 million that was possibly going to Eckerd that adds up to almost $3.5 million both through workforce and through this agreement with the Colorado State Judicial Department.\\nI think there's a lot of support in the community to make sure that organizations can build that capacity as we begin to phase out old systems and asking new questions about that.\\nAnd I'd to get a little bit more information because as much work as the GRID program does in our community since I was elected in 2015 I have attended seven vigils in the Montebello and our community specifically.\\nAnd I want to make sure that we're evaluating it fully and that you're providing all that information to counsel that we can ask good questions.\\nThank you.\\nGreat questions from my colleagues.\\nit's helpful as I'm looking at it some of my questions were asked about dollars that are going to community groups from other budget items.\\nTo Councilwoman Gilmore's question it sounds this money's already spent.\\nTruthfully this contract is the work is already ending.\\nBut the other question I had was in terms of other prevention efforts grasp or other community based organizations I believe we are funding as .\\nand I can I ask a naive question is the difference that this particular program we're here to talk about tonight is for youth who are already justice involved.\\nThat that that answers my question.\\nThe other question I have is you this is ending this contract but you also mentioned our of PS and whatnot.\\nWe have Denver youth safety programs that is in schools today or currently they do pre-arrest diversion programs.\\nAnd that these are programs that are designed to in that school to gyp school to prison pipeline.\\nAnd if we're going to remove SRO as out then could we look at these type of restorative justice practices inside of our schools with community partners because you safety programs they have community partners that they do work with as .\\nAnd the answer to that question is yes.\\nAnd we're going to start we're a part of that stakeholder gathering process that Suzanne Cordova is going to be working with to provide some expertize and also to begin to look at what's the future of of our relationship.\\nI think I stand and supportive of argue safety programs office.\\nThe work that they did at North High School and West Campus were phenomenal.\\nI believe in that program and I think that that can help replace that SRO role that historically was in school.\\nThank you Councilmember.\\nSee no other questions or comments on this one.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n
